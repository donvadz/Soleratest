Update 
----------
Emergrncy change CHG0325215  has been scheduled.

12-07-2021 15:53:47 - Gareth Reynolds (Work notes)
Further to Vijetha's point, by processing the recovered files through MDSPDP, the missing data will end up in MD.PROD.MDSPDP25.EXTRACT, as only the Raw Recipient Data Exports files have been recovered from acoustic. 

There is NO requirement to run GFDADP05 to load CIA_IADS_TBL.lnd_web_tracking.

12-07-2021 14:33:37 - Abhijeet Ranjan (Work notes)
Update :
--------------
Emergency change CHG0325215 is being reviewed.

Update:
-------------
Raised a CAT 3 change CHG0325215 to take adhoc runs of MDSPDP and its successors.

09-07-2021 10:07:11 - Vijetha Prabhu (Work notes)
Update from ISAM IBM Abinitio :

There are two jobs under GFADADP appl :
1. GFADADP05 :
Abinitio Plan : dna_web_tracking_file_load_to_iads.plan
This job uses the MF file - MD.PROD.MDSPDP25.WEB to read the landing data and loads to the table- CIA_IADS_TBL.lnd_web_tracking. 
As a part of adding audit functionality to the job, the below fields are added by our job through a transform function. 
sk_landing_key,data_date,creation_date,source_file_cycle,staging_table_cycle,partitioning_date using a now() function which will populate the current time/timestamp as required. 
The data is then loaded to the  table CIA_IADS_TBL.lnd_web_tracking.

2. GFADADP10:
Abinitio Plan : dna_raw_recipient_file_load_to_iads.plan
This job uses the MF file - MD.PROD.MDSPDP25.EXTRACT to read the landing data and loads to the table- CIA_IADS_TBL.lnd_raw_recipient. 
As a part of adding audit functionality to the job, the below fields are added by our job through a transform function. 
sk_landing_key,data_date,creation_date,source_file_cycle,staging_table_cycle,partitioning_date using a now() function which will populate the current time/timestamp as required. 
The data is then loaded to the  table CIA_IADS_TBL.lnd_raw_recipient.

For the above two jobs , if there is any data missed to the tables then it can be added to their respective input mainframe files and load to tables.  

The similar kind of scenario was handled earlier in incident - INC3800156. 
Please check and let us know if you need any information further.

Update
==================
Dropped a Chaser to IBM AI Team.

08-07-2021 14:32:07 - Chaitanya Kulkarni (Work notes)
Informed IBM AI team to check the issue.

08-07-2021 14:27:58 - Bhushan Chaudhari (Work notes)
Current Status:
---------------------
Had a chat with user and according to him data needs to be updated in below tables:
lnd_raw_recipient, rg_originator and rg_transaction.

GFDADP is a success application of job MDSPDP. GFDADP application loads data into some tables.

Next Action:
--------------------
We will request IBM AI team to provide details of application GFDADP and functionality of GFDADP jobs. Also confirm in which tables this application loads data.

07-07-2021 17:13:28 - Bhushan Chaudhari (Work notes)
We are checking the complete flow of jobs which needs to be run. 
Also checking from which job we have to start the application MDSPDP.
Need to take two runs of jobs. 
1st run - for file of date 25/06/2021 
2nd run - for files from date 26/06/2021 to date 13/06/2021.

07-07-2021 14:29:20 - Gareth Reynolds (Work notes)
Business have requested priority raised to medium, and are looking for a progress update please

06-07-2021 11:58:39 - Ankit Gupta (Work notes)
Dropped a mail to mf recovery team to assign this incident.

06-07-2021 11:15:46 - Ankit Gupta (Work notes)
[‎06/‎07/‎2021 10:29] Gareth Reynolds: 
I wasn't sure whether you'd want to request one large file for the period after 25/5, but I guess the MF team can merge the files together. Please don't pass share the file for 14/6, that is not required. Thanks

06-07-2021 10:27:27 - Ankit Gupta (Work notes)
Update:

As mentioned by Gareth in below comment, only recovery of the files are required in this incident. I will provide the files to mf recovery team and will ask them to run the required jobs.

06-07-2021 10:13:58 - Gareth Reynolds (Work notes)
The business areas have now agreed to proceed with the recovery of the missing Moneyplus data coming from acoustic. As the missing data spans a number of days, I suggest that the recovery is done in two stages, as the first day of data is a significant volume, but the total volume of all subsequent days is much less.

Recovery part 1
---------------------
This just covers the first day, so primarily all the email sends

<MAILING>
<MAILING_ID>45033867</MAILING_ID>
</MAILING>
<EVENT_DATE_START>25/05/2021 00:00:00</EVENT_DATE_START>
<EVENT_DATE_END>26/05/2021 00:00:00</EVENT_DATE_END>

Please run all batch, MDSPDP and dependencies, as per normal acoustic recovery

Recovery part 2
---------------------
The remainder of the missing data.

<MAILING>
<MAILING_ID>45033867</MAILING_ID>
</MAILING>
<EVENT_DATE_START>26/05/2021 00:00:01</EVENT_DATE_START>
<EVENT_DATE_END>14/06/2021 00:00:00</EVENT_DATE_END>

Please run all batch, MDSPDP and dependencies, as per normal acoustic recovery

Thanks Ishwar

The jobs have been re-submitted:

Step 1: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7C4ca31914-6014-4ca3-937f-cfc53562d534

Now that we have the clusters running in P1 and we are able to allocate jobs to them, this ticket is our highest priority.

Thanks

Hi Gareth, 

A second cluster(Milliman Smoke Test 2) has now also successfully been started in the P1 environment that is available for use too. Please feel free to also use this cluster for any pending jobs whilst we continue to work with our provider to confirm full mitigation has been applied.  

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for that.

I can see that the Step1 has successfully deployed its back end resources and tasks are already processing and completing.

We will keep an eye on this and are placing our previously used ""keep alive"" scripts on the clusters we can start, to try and keep them available for Phx.

We will send more updates as we progress.

Kind regards,

Thanks Vishal

I’ve started a new workflow using the ETL refs that allow allocation to a cluster.

The new URLs for the ETL jobs are:

Step 1: https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C9049d384-a8ae-4f15-852f-8874537f76bb

Step 3: https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7Ca9239bf4-dd9f-4ae5-9f1a-3b5bb289b8d6
Step 5: https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C4366a313-9308-4e94-a705-862e0ce6b391

I’ve submitted Step 1 to the Milliman Smoke Test cluster.

Hi Gareth,

Yes, submitting jobs to Compute will be fine. We have taken the proactive approach of pausing the North Europe grid units and provide a temporary EP in their place.

In regards to P1 IDM, we are attempting to scale up the already running cluster ""IFP Job b4f1c090-ffc0-466a-baed-7c6abfff3f59"", which if successful, we maybe able to suggest using to unblock Phoenix. 

We therefore ask that Phoenix does not stop this cluster, but also, that you do not submit runs to it until we have confirmed it is ready to do so.

Kind regards,

Can we safely submit jobs to P1-prd Compute (there is further scenario file production to do today that uses Compute)?

Hi Gareth,

Apologies for not making the update by 09:15.

The latest status of this incident is that Microsoft are working on this as a top priority and have multiple parallel streams of teams investigating all avenues of mitigation. We are currently working closely with them but at this stage cannot provide a firm ETA for resolution.

We apologise for the impact this incident is causing and will continue to work with our service provider and provide updates as we progress.

Hi Gareth,

As a further update, we are still working with our service provider on a top severity ticket to mitigate this issue.

As a precaution, we have also re-injected the two Compute jobs in P1 that were running. They are now running on the temporary grid we have placed in Compute under job IDs 41647 and 10c00.

If you have any further queries or concerns whilst we work to mitigate this issue, please feel free to reach out.

Hi Gareth,

There is currently an outage affecting compute resources in North Europe,  Microsoft is investigating and we do not have an ETA on a resolution yet.  The new cluster hasnt had any failures yet so there is a chance that it will recover on its own once the outage is mitigated. We will keep monitoring and update you once we have more information.

Thanks Dane

In P1 we now have two Step 1 ETL jobs and we need one of them to complete, allowing step 2, 3, and 5 to follow.  Steps 2, 3, 5 are visible in the job list but for clarity:

Initial run
Step 1 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7Ca04aa080-d883-4b0d-a4f1-66395a7fe6c6

I’m always wary about running multiple jobs on the same data mart so we either want the initial run or the re-run to complete, but not both.

I’m going to raise another ticket now for B1 so that it’s officially logged.

Hi Gareth,

We have seen successful cluster start ups in our manual creation of a cluster in B1, following an update from our service provider that mitigation is being rolled out. 

Could we please request for you to retry a job submission via the normal method using a auto-start cluster to confirm if this is now also successful?

As far as I can tell, the version of the IDM script in use in B1 no longer includes versions of the ETL processes that allow us to allocate the job to a cluster manually.  We’re using IDM_Output_2021.RB_V03.

hank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Data Management https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 2.

Issue Description:
https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7Cfc6f0031-02c7-4e6a-84ab-1adad6c5717d

The above ETL has so far failed to start executing because the HDInsight cluster hasn’t stated.  This job is showing similar symptoms to that logged on Milliman ticket 95020 (which relates to an equivalent job in P1).  I’m raising this ticket to keep the issues separately logged.  At this stage the job hasn’t exceeded the re-try limit.

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.

We are working to resolve this issue. If any of the above does not align with your expectations around this ticket, please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, amending your ticket through our web-based portal (http://support.integrate-solutions.com), or by emailing support@integrate-solutions.com.

Good morning Gareth,

As advised last week, unfortunately the original run did go onto complete without intervention, which resulted in the underlying resources being deallocated before we could investigate with our service provider.

They confirmed the behaviour was indicative of a fault node, however, we are unable to gather sufficient evidence to provide an exact root cause.

We apologise for the delay this caused Phoenix.

I will proceed to mark this ticket as resolved, pending closure in 7 days unless you have any concerns or queries.

Hi Gareth and team,

I can confirm that the re-run has completed.

Unfortunately, the original run completed without Milliman intervention. I did raise the incident with our service provider after re-injection however, so they may have been able to grab diagnostic data before the node was lost.

I will keep this ticket on hold pending updates on the investigations into the original job.

Hi Gareth,

As advised on the P1 ticket, the latest status of this incident is that Microsoft are working on this as a top priority and have multiple parallel streams of teams investigating all avenues of mitigation. We are currently working closely with them but at this stage cannot provide a firm ETA for resolution.

We apologise for the impact this incident is causing and will continue to work with our service provider and provide updates as we progress.

It looks like all 8 remaining tasks have been assigned to the same node, indicating a node issue causing the delay.

ETL job affected: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7Cfc6f0031-02c7-4e6a-84ab-1adad6c5717d

Relevant inputs: N/a

Detailed description: The above job should complete in around 30 minutes but is still processing after 8 hours.  Please investigate.  This is running on a gri unit in North Central US so this should be unrelated to the issues in North Europe.  Those other incidents (95020 and 95022) are higher priority.

-811   THE RESULT OF AN EMBEDDED SELECT STATEMENT OR A SUBSELECT IN THE     
       SET CLAUSE OF AN UPDATE STATEMENT IS A TABLE OF MORE THAN ONE ROW,   
       OR THE RESULT OF A SUBQUERY OF A BASIC PREDICATE IS MORE THAN ONE    
       VALUE                                                                
                                                                            
Explanation:                                                                
                                                                            
Execution of an embedded SELECT statement or a subselect in the SET clause  
of an UPDATE statement has resulted in a result table that contains more    
than one row. Alternatively, a subquery contained in a basic predicate has  
produced more than one value.                                               
                                                                            
System Action:                                                              
                                                                            
The statement cannot be executed.                                           
                                                                            
Programmer Response:                                                        
                                                                            
Examine the syntax of the statement to ensure that it contains the proper   
condition specifications. If the statement syntax is correct, there might   
be a problem with the data that is causing more than one row or value to    
be returned when you do not expect it.

Good morning Gareth and team,

Following extensive investigations with our Tier 3 team and service provider, we have identified a rare race condition which results in our Grid Utils component encountering a deadlock situation, which manifests itself as the stalled tasks we saw in this incident. 

To confirm, this is not the same as other stalled tasks tickets, where we have identified hardware or other underlying issues. In this instance, the node was in a healthy state, as confirmed by the fact it continued to process and complete new tasks alongside these stalled tasks.

We have raised this internally under reference 24185, which will see an improvement made to Grid Utils to mitigate the deadlocking issue. 

We will now proceed to resolve this ticket, however, if you have any further concerns or queries, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Thanks Vishal
 
Given the time now, and that we need also the IDM extracts before we can start validating stress results, this is another example of us losing 1 working day on our critical path reporting due to Azure.
 
We have the monthly Service Meeting on Monday and, although it’s to cover June, I’d like to add a discussion item about this issue and the North Europe outage experienced on Wednesday 7 July.

Hi Gareth,

The behaviour you are seeing with the Distributed Merge summary is a known issue which is isolated only to the UI and does not impact the job. The cause of this issue is known and is being addressed in a future release.

In regards to runtime, a few tasks appear to have been rescheduled, which appears to be the cause of the longer than expected run time.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Thanks Vishal
 
Should I be concerned that the remaining 2 jobs are showing more jobs completed than started in the Distributed Merge Process?  These jobs are taking longer than I had expected.

Three of the reinjected jobs have completed with just two remaining.

I will continue to monitor the remaining two whilst we work to investigate the original jobs.

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com)
• Integrate Data Management (https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com)

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 2.

Issue Description:
Summary: 5 jobs in B1-pre Compute that should complete in around 2 hours processing time are still running after 7 hours
Environment: B1-pre
Severity: 2
Reporting period: 06/2021
Valuation activity: Yes
Workspace affected: 2021Q2_Valn_TCF_StochVA_SLHWWP_20210714_R0157 (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=7fc6848b22424e75a40208ea976e1379)


Jobsteps affected: SAB (cc96f), SAF (96f33), SAI (79c13), SAJ (45aa4), SIX (facf1)
Workflow affected: 2021Q2_2021.RB.03_Q2ValnTCF_Step1_20210714_S0019 (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=5f8f6219b27d4aa59bcd85d22836cbd4)
ETL Job affected: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7C9421831c-ee84-4583-bcd7-fe423e5aee56
Data mart affected: GDSKey = 2021Q2_2021.RB_03_ValnTCF
Relevant inputs: N/a

Detailed description: The jobs listed above are examples of several in B1-pre Compute that are taking hours longer to complete processing than expected from an overnight SCR stress run.  These are the only 5 jobs that remain active, all others have completed, and I can see several rescheduled tasks in each.  I do expect these jobs to complete without intervention but I’m raising this incident because the long run times have prevented the related Step1_FCMLoad from proceeding in IDM, impacting our working day timetable.
These jobs are all running on the same grid unit (acphxd12v2b110).

I’d like to know the root cause and whether anything can be learnt for future improvments or monitoring.  With several hundred jobs running I wasn’t able to spot this behaviour until this morning.

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.

We are working to resolve this issue. If any of the above does not align with your expectations around this ticket, please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, amending your ticket through our web-based portal (http://support.integrate-solutions.com), or by emailing support@integrate-solutions.com.

REASON FOR CHANGE - Client has had two updates to the CK preferred name on the same day. This leads to two entries on K01PROD.BUS_CNTCT_NM_T with the same BC_NM_PREF_EFF_DT which then causes SPICE, CK and AI failures.

CPDB is required to move one of these BC_NM_PREF_EFF_DT entries back by one day to allow processing to continue.

DESCRIPTION OF UPDATE REQUIRED - Need to update CK01PROD.BUS_CNTRCT_NM_T as follows:

Hi Gareth,

I wanted to follow up on this ticket as I wanted to check a couple of things.

1) What if any testing will be taking place before these runs with the H8 grids are ran in Production?
2) What core amount is likely to be needed for a) Testing if any and then b) Production.

Thanks,
Paul Beasmore

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for advising.

Looking at Ishwar's investigations, we can advise that the H8m node type looks to be most appropriate.

The H8m machine type is an 8 core node, allowing for up to 14GB of memory per task and up to 125GB of disk space per task, which based on the runs we monitored, would be sufficient to allow the tasks to run without resource constraint. 

Please let me know if you have any follow up concerns or queries with this.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

I’ll discuss this internally but we would also like to know what VM options we have because it is too late to change the model going into P1 for Q3 reporting.

Hi Gareth,

I am picking this ticket up whilst Ishwar is out of office. We have been discussing this internally and whilst we can suggest larger VM sizes, we would first recommend that the data/modelling team investigating this internally before we provide new, larger hardware options. 

If the data/modelling team are able to confirm that these outputs aren't asking for more than they expected to receive and aren't producing larger than expected results, we can then look into suggesting larger hardware. 

We recommend this approach, as it saves Phoenix running on larger, more costly node types, if the runs may not necessarily need them after being reviewed.

Please advise if you feel this is a viable next step, or if you have any concerns or queries with the above.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Hi Jessica,

Thank you for your patience whilst we gathered the details. 

From our review of the re-run I suspect that the original run encountered errors (unexpected task reschedules), due to the node it was executing on running out of disk space. If a node does run out of disk space, it will typically result in any tasks which were executing on the node to unexpectedly reschedule and for the node to potentially enter an unusable state.  

Whilst monitoring the BPM workspace re-run (jobsteps 851 and 901), where we re-injected both jobsteps to run on same node, we observed the free disk space on the node drop to ~50GB out of 200 GB after around 3 days of both jobsteps executing. 

Looking back at the errored run,  it was after approximately 2.5 days where the node encountered the issue. In addition to the 2 jobsteps from the workspace highlighted originally on this ticket, there was however also the 3rd jobstep below from a separate workspace,  that was identified as running simultaneously on the same node from the 27th - 30th July. 

If this 3rd jobstep was of similar size, this would based on the disk space used by the re-run likely have been enough to exhaust the disk space on the node and subsequently cause unexpected task reschedules. 

Jobstep: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/JobStep/Details?workspaceId=90752e33da1241a2a7332f676f1ab3b2&jobStepId=901 
Compute: https://b1-pre.mgalfacompute.com/JobInfo/Details/3c890f43-e556-44ae-9f3e-e4c58112b864 

The latest node metrics recorded in our logging around the time errors started, indicated that the available disk space on the node was at only ~4GB(out of 200GB) on the 30th July at 7:38am.  

This is shortly prior to the highlighted period below, where the errored jobstep initially rescheduled and the node was then unable to successfully restart the task, as it may have become unusable when disk space had become depleted.

https://b1-pre.mgalfacompute.com/JobInfo/Details/7424e77c-293d-4d00-98d7-dff16a112db9 

 

There are larger VM sizes(with increased cost) available that offer more disk space, which on request we could make available to use, should this continue to be an issue on any further executions of these workspaces specifically.  

Please let us know if there are any follow up questions or concerns.

Hi Jessica,

For our troubleshooting, we have re-injected the jobsteps from this workspace so that each of them are running on separate nodes, whilst also leaving the first submissions which are running on the same node for our troubleshooting. 

This is to help determine if this was a factor in the errors encountered on the original run where multiple jobsteps were executing on the same node at the time of the errors.  

Please let us know if you have any questions/concerns regarding this.  

Kind Regards,

Hi Ishwar, 
 
We’ve now set up and started the new BPM workspace and would appreciate if this workspace could be monitored to see if it is affected by the same errors seen within the previous workspace attempt.
 
Workspace is: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=ca25badd54a64045a797be087399552c
 
Many Thanks, 
Jess

Hi Jessica,

On initial investigation of our logs, jobstep 901 appeared to have been processing normally until it encountered unexpected reschedules on the 30th July from which it was unable to recover.  

Jobstep 851 from this same workspace(2021Q2_Valn_BPM_Base_SLHWWP_20210719_R0252) did also encounter similar unexpected reschedules at the same time as 901, however 851 eventually recovered after a few retries, whereas 901 exhausted all retry limits causing the error. Both of these jobsteps notably also encountered these reschedules whilst running on the same node.

The logs captured and reviewed thus far have not identified the cause of these reschedules and with access to the running node no longer available, as the grid scaled down, it will be difficult to further troubleshoot to isolate/confirm what the issue may have been e.g if it was a node specific problem or potentially resource related due to both of these jobsteps running simultaneously on the same node.  

To troubleshoot this further it would be helpful for Milliman to investigate a live running instances of the jobstep, however depending on the expected time for completion for this run, kicking off a re-run now may result in it completing or encountering the same issue over the weekend and us losing the node again.  In which case we would then request another re-run be initiated next week to monitor/review the job over support hours.

Please let us know if you'd prefer to proceed with a re-run attempt or if Phoenix are also happy to do so, re-run the jobstep on Monday morning for example to allow it be investigated by Milliman during support hours. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 3, which is our default.

Issue Description:
Summary:   BPM JS901 completed with errors


Environment:    B1 Pre-Prod
Severity:     3  
Reporting Period:   06/2021
Valuation Activity:   Yes      
Workflow Affected: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7C3d0d8176-5265-4188-84e5-af813c5341bc

Workspaces Affected:   https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=9d3fa644200341449fceaa3ddeb14f52
Jobsteps Affected:      901
Relevant inputs:     Inputs received         

Detailed Description:  As part of the Q2 reporting we’ve ran BPM for the SLAL funds, but JS 901 in the workspace 2021Q2_Valn_BPM_Base_SLHWWP_20210719_R0252 has completed with errors and is now preventing us from loading the full set of BPM results into IDM.
A workspace within the same environment, using the same model but different inputs completed successfully here: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=3a75e3a365c341e4a34b1438a4d1b7f2
Is it possible to investigate why this workspace has completed with errors so we can rerun if required and enable us to load the relevant workspaces into IDM?

REASON FOR CHANGE - Client has had two updates to the CK preferred name on the same day. This leads to two entries on K01PROD.BUS_CNTCT_NM_T with the same BC_NM_PREF_EFF_DT which then causes SPICE, CK and AI failures.

CPDB is required to move one of these BC_NM_PREF_EFF_DT entries back by one day to allow processing to continue.

DESCRIPTION OF UPDATE REQUIRED - Need to update CK01PROD.BUS_CNTRCT_NM_T as follows:

Hi Danial
1. The script needs to be fixed for both issues
2. This fixed script is required for TC1
3. The fixed script needs to be formally delivered
a. NB. If the analysis and solution required for the second issue is extended, PHX will re-visit this decision
Please provide daily updates via this ticket as to the progress on this issue covering:
• Issue 1: Transition script corrected to overwrite i17InputRecID to NA on Scalar File
o Solution developed
• Issue 2: Factor Files not populated with Direct results
o Analysis to date
o Proposed solution
o Expected delivery of solution
I note, by the way, that B3-IDM site is operational

Hi Mike, 
For two issues you are seeing :
• No results for YE18 Transition
o I17InputRecID seems to be the issue here. It is not the same between Model Point File ( set as i17InputRecID = i17CohortID ) and Factor Files ( i17InputRecID = NA)
o IDM scripts should be overwriting i17InputRecID to NA on Model Point File because PHX doesn’t use the New Business/Annual Cohort Functionality 
o This is correctly being done on Subsequent scripts and therefore no such issues there but unfortunately not on Transition scripts
o It seems like we missed this in our testing because the scalar input I used had i17InputRecID already set to “NA” so no such input transformation was actually needed during my tests.
o But in PHX’s case, the scalar input was populated correctly as per the Output Spec and therefore we are seeing this issue. 
o This will require an update to script. 
• IVM Factor Files only have cash flows for Ceded Cohorts for PLG 
o I can confirm that I am seeing this issue as well.
o This will require some investigation from Jay on IDM to see why direct PLG cohorts are being dropped from Factor Files
o B3-IDM site is currently down so this will have to wait until the site is back up and running. 
o This will most likely be a script change too if FCM is producing right results and IDM is not grabbing them properly.
I assume both these issues will require an update/fix to the scripts. I guess the next question here is that if its ok that we fix these issues as part of Phase 2 delivery? Or PHX would like this fixed and tested for TC1?

It seems the query in question was

Delete all entries for T_FCT_BMC_HC_PREMATCH where the BENCHMARK_ID, VALUE_DATE 
apply for rows which have since been updated in the T_FCT_BMC_HC_PREMATCH table

*/

(CONVERT(VARCHAR, BENCHMARK_ID)+'##'+CONVERT(VARCHAR, VALUE_DATE))  
IN
(
SELECT (CONVERT(VARCHAR, BENCHMARK_ID)+'##'+CONVERT(VARCHAR, VALUE_DATE))
  FROM T_FCT_BMC_HC_PREMATCH B1

2021-09-02 11:57:43.67 spid99      Error: 1105, Severity: 17, State: 2.
2021-09-02 11:57:43.67 spid99      Could not allocate space for object 'dbo.SORT temporary run storage:  144248612782080' in database 'tempdb' because the 'PRIMARY' filegroup is full. Create disk space by deleting unneeded files, dropping objects in the filegroup, adding additional files to the filegroup, or setting autogrowth on for existing files in the filegroup.

Tempdb fills up when the amount of processing, and requirement for tempdb space, exceeds that which it was designed for.

Awaiting start time of process in an attempt to ascertain the actual query which caused the issue.
