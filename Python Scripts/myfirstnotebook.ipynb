In this instance, the node was in a healthy state, as confirmed by the fact it continued to process and complete new tasks alongside these stalled tasks.\\n\\nWe have raised this internally under reference 24185, which will see an improvement made to Grid Utils to mitigate the deadlocking issue. \\n\\nWe will now proceed to resolve this ticket, however, if you have any further concerns or queries, please don\\'t hesitate to reach out.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nVishal Tween\\nOperations Specialist - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman\\nsupport@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n21-07-2021 10:14:15 - Daniel Robinson (Work notes)\\nFrom: Vishal Tween (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 21 July 2021 10:10\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Ticket Updated] 95209 || INC4142307 - NEW INCIDENT: B1 Compute jobs slow to completeâ\\x80\\x93 15 July 2021 ||\\n\\nAlert!

These hardware issues resulted in the the two nodes running significantly slower than the other nodes handling these jobs. The nodes did go on to complete their tasks, however, the runtime of these tasks was considerably longer than it should have been.\\n\\nWe are working with our service provider to improve the way in which these types of issues are identified and mitigated, as discussed outside of this ticket. In this instance, I can advise that our service provider is working to make improvements to their hardware screening process to help avoid hardware issues impacting live nodes. They are also working to make improvements to their monitoring and telemetry services as well as the handling of such memory failures, to reduce the overall impact in future cases.\\n\\nDo you have any further concerns or queries with this incident, or are you happy for us to resolve this ticket?\\n\\nKind regards,\\nVishal Tween\\nOperations Specialist - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman\\nsupport@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n20-07-2021 14:10:49 - Kieran Bramwell (Work notes)\\nFrom: Vishal Tween (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 20 July 2021 14:05\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Ticket Updated] 95325 || INC4147620: NEW INCIDENT: 8 stalled or slow jobs in T2-pre â\\x80\\x93 20 July 2021 ||\\n\\nAlert!

In summary, the way IDM is set up is that each ETL in the script package has a profile (Small, Medium, Large) associated with it. In the release notes we also recommend the specs of the HDInsight clusters corresponding to each of those Small/Medium/Large clusters. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a setup that needs to happen for any implementation, but once itâ\\x80\\x99s done thereâ\\x80\\x99s no re-profiling that needs to happen. \\n \\nOr is the concern that you have Small / Medium / Large profiles already set up & working for other applications, that are different from what we suggest for i17? If that is a concern Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend setting up i17-specific clusters per the release notes (eg, i17_Small, i17_Med, i17_Large); itâ\\x80\\x99d require a small amount of work for you to create the profiles in your environment & then for us to rename the profiles in our scripts, but that should be just a fairly small 1-time change.\\n \\nLet me know if that makes sense, or if Iâ\\x80\\x99m not understanding the question.

In this case though, the bottleneck is a lot more obvious because we can see the dependency requests for the scenario files on the separate testing not being fulfilled.\\n \\nThese runs use the TCF Deterministic template in MG-ALFA, running 880 jobsteps in 11 workspaces (so 9,680 jobsteps) and the TCF Stochastic template, running 268 jobsteps in 11 workspaces (another 2,948 jobsteps).  These are large volumes relative to heritage Phoenix, so thereâ\\x80\\x99s an internal discussion to be had about whether we can cut down the number of results files per jobstep, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d also be interested to know if anything can be done to accommodate these volumes on the DEI.\\n \\nThanks\\nGareth\\n \\n \\n\\nGareth Thomas | Production Manager\\noffice: +442035679795 | email: gareth.thomas@thephoenixgroup.com\\nP Please help save the environment, print only if necessary.\\n\\n23-07-2021 14:10:48 - Gavin Jaigopaul (Work notes)\\nFrom: Paul Beasmore (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 23 July 2021 13:20\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Ticket Updated] 95420 || INC4150673: NEW INCIDENT: T2 TCF results processing query - 23 July 2021 ||\\n\\nAlert!

We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.\\n\\nService(s) Impacted:\\nâ\\x80¢ Integrate Financial Projections https://t1.mgalfacloud.com\\nâ\\x80¢ Integrate Data Management https://idm-t1.mgalfacloud.com\\n\\n\\nSeverity:\\nThis incident is being logged with a severity level of 3.\\n\\nIssue Description:\\nAn IDM load has completed successfully for the above workspaces, along with a number of other workspaces. The project have tested specific overrides in these workspaces and are now loading them into IDM. The other workspaces within the list seen in the Step 1 workflow (https://t1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=df627b82fb0a42289c0e755777e9f107) have loaded successfully, and the outputs can be seen within the IDM extracts created. The two workspaces listed above have failed to produce any data within the extracts even though they have completed successfully and appear to have loaded correctly in IDM. This is the first time weâ\\x80\\x99ve ran workspaces with these settings so we have nothing to compare back to with a successful IDM load. Is it possible to investigate the cause of the missing data from within the extracts produced?\\n\\nScope Agreement:\\nWe will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.\\n\\nWe are working to resolve this issue.

Based on the errors encountered I believe the cause is related to the cluster size being used on this second ETL and I\\'m currently verifying this internally. \\n\\nOn initial look, the first ETL in the process which now completes successfully uses the Medium Execution Profile while the second part of the ETL is set to use the configured size for the Large Execution Profile. \\n\\nBoth Medium and Large profiles in B3 are however currently configured to use the same size and it is likely that we\\'ll need to update the Large cluster profile with different settings which I am confirming.\\n\\n \\n\\nI will keep you updated with further details on next steps. \\n\\nKind Regards,\\nIshwar Johal\\nOperations Specialist - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk\\nsupport@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n29-07-2021 12:58:50 - Daniel Smith (Work notes)\\nMichael Brunt \\nJul 29, 2021, 11:50 UTC \\nPlease see new incident where second ETL process of workflow is taking a troublingly long time\\n \\nRegards\\nMike\\n \\n \\n\\nMike Brunt | MG-ALFA Team Analyst\\noffice: +442035679384 | email: michael.brunt@thephoenixgroup.com\\nP Please help save the environment, print only if necessary.\\n \\nFrom: Paul Beasmore (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: Thursday, July 29, 2021 11:43 AM\\nCc: Mohua Banerjee (Sopra) <Mohua.Banerjee@thephoenixgroup.com>; Michael Brunt <Michael.Brunt@thephoenixgroup.com>; Matthew Richards <Matthew.Richards@thephoenixgroup.com>; Milliman Test Notifications <milliman_test_notifications@thephoenixgroup.com>; Stefan Marion <Stefan.Marion@thephoenixgroup.com>; Rob Smith <Rob.Smith@thephoenixgroup.com>; Raj Atwal <Raj.Atwal@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] Milliman Support Request: INC4156154: NEW INCIDENT: B3 Workflow Failing to Transform IFRS17\\n \\nAlert!

We have been discussing this internally and whilst we can suggest larger VM sizes, we would first recommend that the data/modelling team investigating this internally before we provide new, larger hardware options. \\n\\nIf the data/modelling team are able to confirm that these outputs aren\\'t asking for more than they expected to receive and aren\\'t producing larger than expected results, we can then look into suggesting larger hardware. \\n\\nWe recommend this approach, as it saves Phoenix running on larger, more costly node types, if the runs may not necessarily need them after being reviewed.\\n\\nPlease advise if you feel this is a viable next step, or if you have any concerns or queries with the above.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nVishal Tween\\nOperations Specialist - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman\\nsupport@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n26-08-2021 14:47:14 - Gavin Jaigopaul (Work notes)\\nFrom: Ishwar Johal (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 26 August 2021 13:00\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Ticket Updated] 95712 || INC4162429 - New Incident: B1 BPM JS 901 complete with errors - 5 August 2021 ||\\n\\nAlert!

If a node does run out of disk space, it will typically result in any tasks which were executing on the node to unexpectedly reschedule and for the node to potentially enter an unusable state.  \\n\\nWhilst monitoring the BPM workspace re-run (jobsteps 851 and 901), where we re-injected both jobsteps to run on same node, we observed the free disk space on the node drop to ~50GB out of 200 GB after around 3 days of both jobsteps executing. \\n\\nLooking back at the errored run,  it was after approximately 2.5 days where the node encountered the issue. In addition to the 2 jobsteps from the workspace highlighted originally on this ticket, there was however also the 3rd jobstep below from a separate workspace,  that was identified as running simultaneously on the same node from the 27th - 30th July. \\n\\nIf this 3rd jobstep was of similar size, this would based on the disk space used by the re-run likely have been enough to exhaust the disk space on the node and subsequently cause unexpected task reschedules. \\n\\nJobstep: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/JobStep/Details?workspaceId=90752e33da1241a2a7332f676f1ab3b2&jobStepId=901 \\nCompute: https://b1-pre.mgalfacompute.com/JobInfo/Details/3c890f43-e556-44ae-9f3e-e4c58112b864 \\n\\nThe latest node metrics recorded in our logging around the time errors started, indicated that the available disk space on the node was at only ~4GB(out of 200GB) on the 30th July at 7:38am.  \\n\\nThis is shortly prior to the highlighted period below, where the errored jobstep initially rescheduled and the node was then unable to successfully restart the task, as it may have become unusable when disk space had become depleted.\\n\\nhttps://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=9d3fa644200341449fceaa3ddeb14f52 \\nhttps://b1-pre.mgalfacompute.com/JobInfo/Details/7424e77c-293d-4d00-98d7-dff16a112db9 \\n\\n \\n\\nThere are larger VM sizes(with increased cost) available that offer more disk space, which on request we could make available to use, should this continue to be an issue on any further executions of these workspaces specifically.  \\n\\nPlease let us know if there are any follow up questions or concerns. \\n\\nKind Regards\\nIshwar Johal\\nOperations Specialist - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk\\nsupport@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n13-08-2021 18:37:01 - Gavin Jaigopaul (Work notes)\\nFrom: Ishwar Johal (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 13 August 2021 17:56\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Ticket Updated] 95712 || INC4162429 - New Incident: B1 BPM JS 901 complete with errors - 5 August 2021 ||\\n\\nAlert!

To add additional comments, reply to this email.\\nLatest Comment: \\n \\nIshwar Johal (Milliman LTS Support) \\nAug 5, 2021, 14:21 UTC \\nHi Jessica,\\n\\nOn initial investigation of our logs, jobstep 901 appeared to have been processing normally until it encountered unexpected reschedules on the 30th July from which it was unable to recover.  \\n\\nJobstep 851 from this same workspace(2021Q2_Valn_BPM_Base_SLHWWP_20210719_R0252) did also encounter similar unexpected reschedules at the same time as 901, however 851 eventually recovered after a few retries, whereas 901 exhausted all retry limits causing the error. Both of these jobsteps notably also encountered these reschedules whilst running on the same node.\\n\\nThe logs captured and reviewed thus far have not identified the cause of these reschedules and with access to the running node no longer available, as the grid scaled down, it will be difficult to further troubleshoot to isolate/confirm what the issue may have been e.g if it was a node specific problem or potentially resource related due to both of these jobsteps running simultaneously on the same node.  \\n\\nTo troubleshoot this further it would be helpful for Milliman to investigate a live running instances of the jobstep, however depending on the expected time for completion for this run, kicking off a re-run now may result in it completing or encountering the same issue over the weekend and us losing the node again.  In which case we would then request another re-run be initiated next week to monitor/review the job over support hours.\\n\\nPlease let us know if you\\'d prefer to proceed with a re-run attempt or if Phoenix are also happy to do so, re-run the jobstep on Monday morning for example to allow it be investigated by Milliman during support hours. \\n\\nKind Regards,\\nIshwar Johal\\nOperations Specialist - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk\\nsupport@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n05-08-2021 12:51:09 - Gavin Jaigopaul (Work notes)\\nFrom: Tahir Hussain (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 05 August 2021 12:44\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Ticket Updated] 95712 || INC4162429 - New Incident: B1 BPM JS 901 complete with errors - 5 August 2021 ||\\n\\nAlert!

However, we have dedicated IFP publish ETLs for New Bus and Subsequent runs and the Valuation dates of these would be different as well. So even if the sys.dataversion key is same, we will have other metadata that will be different and it will work.  Apologies, if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand your question properly but in short, it is always safe to have different sys,dataversion key for each workflow. \\n \\nAs to your second point, I was aware that we did not have ENTPLAL new business, but why would this lead to an â\\x80\\x98emptyâ\\x80\\x99 MPF â\\x80\\x93 does the DEI filter the scalar file in to Entity specific files? Could this and other specifics of the system be include in expanded configuration documentation from Milliman.\\n[DK] It is just how IDM works with Model point files. I believe the technical term here is â\\x80\\x9cPartition Transformâ\\x80\\x9d. If the data is not there for a certain entity [ENTPLAL in this case], there is no way for IDM to know that it needs to publish MPF for ENTPLAL. Running with an empty MPF is the same as not running ENTPLAL NB workspace at all. Can that be an option for TC1?   I can include this as part of expanded configuration. \\n \\n \\nFinally, as to your first point, I feel this is a change of approach from 2020 Wave 1, but cannot be sure. As such @Fab, please note for new business scalar file, the internal valuation date needs to be that of the previous year end (reflecting the MPF etc.).\\n[DK] Unsure if I my input was needed here.   \\n \\n \\n \\nRegards\\nMike\\n \\n \\n\\nMike Brunt | MG-ALFA Team Analyst\\noffice: +442035679384 | email: michael.brunt@thephoenixgroup.com\\nP Please help save the environment, print only if necessary.\\n \\nFrom: Danial Kherani <Danial.Kherani@milliman.com> \\nSent: Friday, August 6, 2021 1:32 PM\\nTo: integrate-solutions.com <support@integrate-solutions.com>; Michael Brunt <Michael.Brunt@thephoenixgroup.com>; Matthew Richards <Matthew.Richards@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nCc: Tom Kim <Tom.Kim@milliman.com>; Jay Brown <jay.brown@milliman.com>; Mohua Banerjee (Sopra) <Mohua.Banerjee@thephoenixgroup.com>; Production Admin Team <ProductionAdminTeam@thephoenixgroup.com>; Stefan Marion <Stefan.Marion@thephoenixgroup.com>; Rob Smith <Rob.Smith@thephoenixgroup.com>; Raj Atwal <Raj.Atwal@thephoenixgroup.com>; Sarah Cooper (Milliman) <Sarah.Cooper@milliman.com>\\nSubject: [External] RE: Milliman Support Request: INC4163179: NEW INCIDENT: B3 IVM New Business Workspaces Failing\\n \\nAlert!

This has been raised to our tier 3 team who are working on fixes to prevent such issues from occuring when the environment is under a particularly heavy load. \\n\\nApologies for the inconvenience/delay this has caused.

We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.\\n\\nService(s) Impacted:\\nâ\\x80¢ Integrate Financial Projections (https://t2.mgalfacloud.com)\\nâ\\x80¢ Integrate Data Management (https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com)\\n\\nSeverity:\\nThis incident is being logged with a severity level of 3, which is our default.\\n\\nIssue Description:\\nSummary: Job 6988f is running longer than expected and may have encountered a Compute issue\\nEnvironment: T2-pre\\nSeverity: 3\\nReporting period: 06/2021\\nValuation activity: No (IMOR DR6)\\nWorkspace affected: 2021Q2_IMOR_DR6_LSMC_40kOutx12in40Bat_PearlWP_20210809_R0398 (https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=ec19eb50c3b24173ad78cd40e2be3254)\\nJobstep affected: 107 (6988f113-aafc-41f7-9f57-41d8cfb89dc9)\\nETL job affected: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C59a19cf3-f3a1-4212-8b8a-1376b61fcfbb\\nData mart affected: GDSKey = 2021Q2_IMOR_DR6_LSMC_Main_PHX\\nRelevant inputs: N/a\\n\\nDetailed description: The above job has been running for around 11 hours and 8 of the tasks have not yet completed.  Looking at other jobs within the same workspace, total runtime is around 7.5 hours.  And looking at the task log, the last job to complete was at 23:11, with each task taking less than 30 minutes.  This suggests a Compute issue is affecting the remaining 8 tasks, which will need investigating.  This is preventing an LSMC ETL process in IDM from progressing.\\n\\nScope Agreement:\\nWe will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.\\n\\nWe are working to resolve this issue. If any of the above does not align with your expectations around this ticket, please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, amending your ticket through our web-based portal (http://support.integrate-solutions.com), or by emailing support@integrate-solutions.com.\\n\\nRegards,\\nTahir Hussain Operations Analyst - Life Technology Solutions\\nMilliman +1 (888) 600 8188 or +44 20 3608 0105 support@integrate-solutions.com\\n\\n10-08-2021 08:23:40 - Kieran Bramwell (Work notes)\\nFrom: Milliman Support <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 10 August 2021 08:23\\nTo: Service Desk <Service.Desk@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] [Request received] ID: [Request received] 95809 || INC4165720 - NEW INCIDENT: Long running job in T2 (6988f) â\\x80\\x93 10 August 2021\\n\\nAlert!

So I think youâ\\x80\\x99ll just need to restart your workflow.\\n \\nFor further background unfortunately there appears to be some stale documentation in the release notes â\\x80\\x93 the cluster size indicated for the large profile was a remnant of the Wave 1 work (back when we didnâ\\x80\\x99t have these DEI Vector input loads) & the actual specs that we used in successful T4 testing were consistent with the new i17_Large profile that is now in B3. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll send an update to the release notes on Tuesday that documents both the new i17-specific execution profiles as well as the updated hardware specifications. (You wonâ\\x80\\x99t need to do any setup for those, since that has already been done).\\n \\nThanks,\\n \\nTom Kim, FSA, FCIA, MAAA \\nPrincipal & Consulting Actuary â\\x80\\x93 Life Technology Solutions\\n \\nMilliman\\n \\n+1 206 777 4350 Direct\\n+1 416 823 8551 Mobile\\n \\nmilliman.com| email | linkedin\\n \\nFrom: Tom Kim \\nSent: Monday, August 9, 2021 10:38 AM\\nTo: Michael Brunt <Michael.Brunt@thephoenixgroup.com>; Danial Kherani <Danial.Kherani@milliman.com>; integrate-solutions.com <support@integrate-solutions.com>\\nCc: Mohua Banerjee (Sopra) <Mohua.Banerjee@thephoenixgroup.com>; Matthew Richards <Matthew.Richards@thephoenixgroup.com>; Rob Smith <Rob.Smith@thephoenixgroup.com>; Raj Atwal <Raj.Atwal@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: RE: [External] Milliman Support Request: INC4164948: NEW INCIDENT: B3 Workflow Failed IFRS17\\n \\nMike, Danial is currently running a test to confirm whether this is the same issue as what we saw last week for INC4148709 (except this time with Inception/Subsequent instead of Transition).

We donâ\\x80\\x99t believe this is the case with these workflows. \\n \\nAs we are seeing this error across multiple environment, it feels as though there could be an underlying issue that is currently affecting the ESG Production using XSG Workflows.\\n \\nOn your recommendation, we asked the ESG team to repackage the workflow inputs for T2 and P1, as both sites were affected by what appeared to be the same error.\\n \\nP1 original workflow â\\x80\\x93 https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=59f24a72770746a1a41dab7b52054f03\\nP1 repackaged workflow â\\x80\\x93 https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=cc316f51ccf54eae96be0c9e187933b2\\n \\nT2 original workflow â\\x80\\x93 https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=4367a38a10f449a3a3b9b780337c53eb\\nT2 repackaged workflow â\\x80\\x93 https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=7226af4db62d49cca95c1486dc2f9640\\n \\nOutputs from the original workflows have been downloaded and the outputs have been compared and we donâ\\x80\\x99t believe this is the same as the previous issue from #88390.\\n \\nThe inputs used for the T2 1p1g workflow were originally ran through P1 as part of Q2 valuation and successfully produced the files using the same naming conventions and file formatting, suggesting the names were matching correctly at this point : https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=da3bbdb47aca4aaeac097d9aff289ed9\\n \\nThe production of these files is now affecting P1 as well as the testing environments, is this something that can be further investigated to try and understand the cause of these errors? \\n \\nMany Thanks, \\nJess\\n \\n \\n\\nJessica Glenn | Production Administration Manager\\noffice: +442035679135 | email: jessica.glenn@thephoenixgroup.com\\nP Please help save the environment, print only if necessary.\\n\\nFrom: Vishal Tween (Milliman Support) <support@integrate-solutions.com> \\nSent: 24 August 2021 11:22\\nCc: Janet Beamish <Janet.Beamish@ThePhoenixGroup.Com>; ESG Team <ESGTeam@thephoenixgroup.com>; Milliman Test Notifications <milliman_test_notifications@thephoenixgroup.com>; Finance Systems - Release Team <financesystemsreleaseteam@thephoenixgroup.com>\\nSubject: [External] Milliman Support Request: INC4179135: New Integrate incident - T2-pre - XSG workflows failed - no useful error message\\n \\nAlert!
