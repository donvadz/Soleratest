Subject: New Incident: Files failed to move location using MoveIt

Morning All, 

Yesterday we had the Q2 ESG files delivered to Prod Admin by the ESG team using their standard practise of creating the files needed and adding them to the R drive (R:\reporting\MG-ALFA\Production Team\ESG Team\ESG_Cloud_Inputs_and_Outputs\P1\esg_input\202106). These files should then automatically move to the S Drive location (S:\prod-94\actuarial\ic\raw_files\esg_data\esg_input\202106) which has failed.

We're unable to create the required Scenario files due to this failure, is it possible for someone to look at the MoveIt rules and ensure everything is working as expected please? There were files added to the location in the morning of 5th July just after 10am which have moved successfully but the later files have failed and are needed urgently for Q2 Reporting.

Many Thanks, 
Jess

Hi Ishwar
 
I’ve been looking into this since the ticket was raised and I believe the format of the Phoenix Inputs package is wrong (the ESGXss file).  The top level folder in the Zip package should be Phoenix Inputs but that’s not been done.  I’ve let our ESG Team know and I suggest we stop your investigation and close this ticket.
 
Apologies for the time taken on this ticket.
 
Thanks
Gareth

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for that.

I can see that the Step1 has successfully deployed its back end resources and tasks are already processing and completing.

We will keep an eye on this and are placing our previously used ""keep alive"" scripts on the clusters we can start, to try and keep them available for Phx.

We will send more updates as we progress.

I’ve started a new workflow using the ETL refs that allow allocation to a cluster.

The new URLs for the ETL jobs are:

Step 1: https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C9049d384-a8ae-4f15-852f-8874537f76bb

I’ve submitted Step 1 to the Milliman Smoke Test cluster.

Hi Gareth,

Yes, submitting jobs to Compute will be fine. We have taken the proactive approach of pausing the North Europe grid units and provide a temporary EP in their place.

In regards to P1 IDM, we are attempting to scale up the already running cluster ""IFP Job b4f1c090-ffc0-466a-baed-7c6abfff3f59"", which if successful, we maybe able to suggest using to unblock Phoenix. 

We therefore ask that Phoenix does not stop this cluster, but also, that you do not submit runs to it until we have confirmed it is ready to do so.

Kind regards,

Can we safely submit jobs to P1-prd Compute (there is further scenario file production to do today that uses Compute)?

Hi Gareth,

Apologies for not making the update by 09:15.

The latest status of this incident is that Microsoft are working on this as a top priority and have multiple parallel streams of teams investigating all avenues of mitigation. We are currently working closely with them but at this stage cannot provide a firm ETA for resolution.

We apologise for the impact this incident is causing and will continue to work with our service provider and provide updates as we progress.

Hi Gareth,

As a further update, we are still working with our service provider on a top severity ticket to mitigate this issue.

As a precaution, we have also re-injected the two Compute jobs in P1 that were running. They are now running on the temporary grid we have placed in Compute under job IDs 41647 and 10c00.

If you have any further queries or concerns whilst we work to mitigate this issue, please feel free to reach out. 

Kind regards,

Hi Gareth,

There is currently an outage affecting compute resources in North Europe,  Microsoft is investigating and we do not have an ETA on a resolution yet.  The new cluster hasnt had any failures yet so there is a chance that it will recover on its own once the outage is mitigated. We will keep monitoring and update you once we have more information.

Thanks Dane

In P1 we now have two Step 1 ETL jobs and we need one of them to complete, allowing step 2, 3, and 5 to follow.  Steps 2, 3, 5 are visible in the job list but for clarity:

Initial run
Step 1 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7Ca04aa080-d883-4b0d-a4f1-66395a7fe6c6
Step 2 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7Ca252572c-b865-45ae-828d-53b648624caf
Step 3 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C662d2bf9-4ae7-4b35-b557-d7518e4a7c31
Step 5 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C1b419e0d-9fa4-4a75-8780-c6350224532c

Re-run
Step 1 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7Caecc3357-d2f8-44c3-a138-953b126afa1f
Step 2 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7Ce700ec88-3dce-4a80-81e6-7dff6a571038
Step 3 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C4c0d6004-5bfb-4ba5-8d38-678905658bcb
Step 5 = https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/p1-production%7C%7C92de5008-fa15-4bdc-ac82-e0f3a30a6280

I’m always wary about running multiple jobs on the same data mart so we either want the initial run or the re-run to complete, but not both.

I’m going to raise another ticket now for B1 so that it’s officially logged.

Hi Gareth,

We have seen successful cluster start ups in our manual creation of a cluster in B1, following an update from our service provider that mitigation is being rolled out. 

Could we please request for you to retry a job submission via the normal method using a auto-start cluster to confirm if this is now also successful?

As far as I can tell, the version of the IDM script in use in B1 no longer includes versions of the ETL processes that allow us to allocate the job to a cluster manually.  We’re using IDM_Output_2021.RB_V03.

hank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Data Management https://idm-p1.mgalfacloud.com

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 2.

Issue Description:
https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7Cfc6f0031-02c7-4e6a-84ab-1adad6c5717d

The above ETL has so far failed to start executing because the HDInsight cluster hasn’t stated.  This job is showing similar symptoms to that logged on Milliman ticket 95020 (which relates to an equivalent job in P1).  I’m raising this ticket to keep the issues separately logged.  At this stage the job hasn’t exceeded the re-try limit.

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working.

Subject: NEW INCIDENT: B1 ETL job HDInsight cluster not starting – 8 July 2021

Hi,

I'd like to raise a new MG-ALFA service request ticket, to be followed up with a Phoenix ticket reference when the Phoenix Service Desk opens.

---------------------

Summary: A Step1_FCMLoad ETL job in B1 hasn't started executing in over 1 hour due to the HDInsight cluster not starting

Environment: B1 IDM

Severity: 2

Reporting period: 06/2021

Valuation activity: Yes

Workflow affected: 2021Q2_Valn_2021.RB_03_20210707_Base_S0003 (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=f064c715aae24e2c8483c27dac643db7)

ETL Job affected: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7Cfc6f0031-02c7-4e6a-84ab-1adad6c5717d

Data mart affected: GDSKey = 2021Q2_2021.RB_03_VALN

Relevant inputs: N/a

Detailed description: The above ETL has so far failed to start executing because the HDInsight cluster hasn't stated.  This job is showing similar symptoms to that logged on Milliman ticket 95020 (which relates to an equivalent job in P1).  I'm raising this ticket to keep the issues separately logged.  At this stage the job hasn't exceeded the re-try limit.

Gareth

Good morning Gareth,

As advised last week, unfortunately the original run did go onto complete without intervention, which resulted in the underlying resources being deallocated before we could investigate with our service provider.

They confirmed the behaviour was indicative of a fault node, however, we are unable to gather sufficient evidence to provide an exact root cause.

We apologise for the delay this caused Phoenix.

I will proceed to mark this ticket as resolved, pending closure in 7 days unless you have any concerns or queries.

Kind regards,

Hi Gareth and team,

I can confirm that the re-run has completed.

Unfortunately, the original run completed without Milliman intervention. I did raise the incident with our service provider after re-injection however, so they may have been able to grab diagnostic data before the node was lost.

I will keep this ticket on hold pending updates on the investigations into the original job.

Kind regards,

Hi Gareth,

As advised on the P1 ticket, the latest status of this incident is that Microsoft are working on this as a top priority and have multiple parallel streams of teams investigating all avenues of mitigation. We are currently working closely with them but at this stage cannot provide a firm ETA for resolution.

We apologise for the impact this incident is causing and will continue to work with our service provider and provide updates as we progress.

Hi Gareth,

It looks like all 8 remaining tasks have been assigned to the same node, indicating a node issue causing the delay.

Would you like us to re-inject the job and attempt to preserve this job for investigation, or would you prefer us to unblock it now?

Good morning Gareth and team,

Following extensive investigations with our Tier 3 team and service provider, we have identified a rare race condition which results in our Grid Utils component encountering a deadlock situation, which manifests itself as the stalled tasks we saw in this incident. 

To confirm, this is not the same as other stalled tasks tickets, where we have identified hardware or other underlying issues. In this instance, the node was in a healthy state, as confirmed by the fact it continued to process and complete new tasks alongside these stalled tasks.

We have raised this internally under reference 24185, which will see an improvement made to Grid Utils to mitigate the deadlocking issue. 

We will now proceed to resolve this ticket, however, if you have any further concerns or queries, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Thanks Vishal
 
Given the time now, and that we need also the IDM extracts before we can start validating stress results, this is another example of us losing 1 working day on our critical path reporting due to Azure.
 
We have the monthly Service Meeting on Monday and, although it’s to cover June, I’d like to add a discussion item about this issue and the North Europe outage experienced on Wednesday 7 July.

Hi Gareth,

The behaviour you are seeing with the Distributed Merge summary is a known issue which is isolated only to the UI and does not impact the job. The cause of this issue is known and is being addressed in a future release.

In regards to runtime, a few tasks appear to have been rescheduled, which appears to be the cause of the longer than expected run time.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Should I be concerned that the remaining 2 jobs are showing more jobs completed than started in the Distributed Merge Process?  These jobs are taking longer than I had expected.

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com)
• Integrate Data Management (https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com)

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 2.

Issue Description:
Summary: 5 jobs in B1-pre Compute that should complete in around 2 hours processing time are still running after 7 hours
Environment: B1-pre
Severity: 2
Reporting period: 06/2021
Valuation activity: Yes
Workspace affected: 2021Q2_Valn_TCF_StochVA_SLHWWP_20210714_R0157 (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=7fc6848b22424e75a40208ea976e1379)


Jobsteps affected: SAB (cc96f), SAF (96f33), SAI (79c13), SAJ (45aa4), SIX (facf1)
Workflow affected: 2021Q2_2021.RB.03_Q2ValnTCF_Step1_20210714_S0019 (https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=5f8f6219b27d4aa59bcd85d22836cbd4)
ETL Job affected: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7C9421831c-ee84-4583-bcd7-fe423e5aee56
Data mart affected: GDSKey = 2021Q2_2021.RB_03_ValnTCF
Relevant inputs: N/a

Detailed description: The jobs listed above are examples of several in B1-pre Compute that are taking hours longer to complete processing than expected from an overnight SCR stress run.  These are the only 5 jobs that remain active, all others have completed, and I can see several rescheduled tasks in each.  I do expect these jobs to complete without intervention but I’m raising this incident because the long run times have prevented the related Step1_FCMLoad from proceeding in IDM, impacting our working day timetable.
These jobs are all running on the same grid unit (acphxd12v2b110).

I’d like to know the root cause and whether anything can be learnt for future improvments or monitoring.  With several hundred jobs running I wasn’t able to spot this behaviour until this morning.

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.

We are working to resolve this issue. If any of the above does not align with your expectations around this ticket, please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, amending your ticket through our web-based portal (http://support.integrate-solutions.com), or by emailing support@integrate-solutions.com.

Hi Gareth, 

Following investigation, our service provider confirmed the cause of this issue as a service which had entered into an error state. 

This problem instance of the service was erroneously creating duplicate events which had impacted and created a duplicate for one of the activities in this ETL run, when the background deployment was created. 

This resulted in the ETL to stall, as although the conditions for the next part of the job to run would have been satisfied with all transforms having completed,  the unexpected duplicate activity was not going to execute which prevented further downstream activities from starting.

Our provider performed a clean up of the problem service and duplicate records and is currently working on rolling out a fix to prevent and filter these out in case of any future occurrence. 

Apologies for the inconvenience this caused, please let us know if you have any follow up questions. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Thanks Gareth,

We will monitor the re-run for any issues. 


We are currently investigating the issue alongside our service provider, as we identified a background activity on this job had not updated as expected during the original run attempt.

Attempts were made to unblock the run which were unfortunately unsuccessful and we are continuing to investigate the root cause.

Apologies for the inconvenience this may have caused.  We will provide further updates as they become available.

This is an example that was started at the same time using the same script: https://idm-t1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t1-preproduction%7C%7C9d2e52a2-8247-45cd-90c1-ce15dba3935f.  The two jobs have different workspace inputs but I’d expect similar run times.
 
Thanks, we’ll set up a re-run overnight if we’re unable to make any progress in the next hour or so.

Hi Gareth,

Has this script been ran successfully before? If so, could you please provide a recent example?

I have raised a top severity ticket with our service provider to assist our investigations, however, if this is a time sensitive run, it may be worth re-running the ETL to confirm that this issue is isolated to the original run. 

If you do choose to re-run, please provide the URL.

Kind regards,

Hi Gareth,

Thank you for the additional information, we'll work with our provider based on this and keep you updated. 

If you are happy for me to do so I can scale back the D4v2 capacity today or I can do this at a later date if required. 

Kind Regards,

Hi Ishwar
 
I’m anticipating using this grid booking for a 24 hour period at some point during the 7 day window.  The target is to start the MG-ALFA run on Friday 23 July but this is at high risk of delay, hence the contingency in the booking.
 
Looking at the D4v2 capacity in T1, I am happy for this to be scaled back to 30,000 cores, which will be utilised in parallel with the D12v2 cores.  We no longer need 85,000 D4v2 cores in T1-pre.
 
Thanks
Gareth

Hi Gareth, 

We will work with our provider on this request and keep you updated on the status. This will be to increase the D12v2 EP(PhxT1D12v2) to a total of 100,000 cores.  

To gauge potential total core usage across this environment during this period, will the PhxT1D4v2(D4v2 Node size) EP which currently has 85,000 cores allocated also be utilized during this period and if so is there an estimate on how many of these cores potentially will be? This will help our provider determine the best regions for this period for the additional cores for this request.  

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Hi Gareth,

Could I please confirm the request to ensure I have interpreted it correctly?

There are currently 20,000 D12v2 cores and 50,000 D4v2 cores in T2. Are you requesting that number be taken up to 70,000 D12v2 and 100,000 D4v2? Totalling 170,000 available cores in T2.

Hi Gareth and team,

Thank you for your patience whilst we investigated this incident further.

Our investigations into this issue have identified that the two nodes responsible for this delay had encountered physical memory issues on the underlying host platform. These hardware issues resulted in the the two nodes running significantly slower than the other nodes handling these jobs. The nodes did go on to complete their tasks, however, the runtime of these tasks was considerably longer than it should have been.

We are working with our service provider to improve the way in which these types of issues are identified and mitigated, as discussed outside of this ticket. In this instance, I can advise that our service provider is working to make improvements to their hardware screening process to help avoid hardware issues impacting live nodes. They are also working to make improvements to their monitoring and telemetry services as well as the handling of such memory failures, to reduce the overall impact in future cases.

Do you have any further concerns or queries with this incident, or are you happy for us to resolve this ticket?

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for logging the ticket.

I just wanted to provide a quick update as we had actually been alerted about these jobs and were just about to start investigating, 

I had actually asked just asked Vishal to check during our daily grid check, as I had received alerts via our monitoring system.

We will send further updates ASAP.

It was worth checking.  It looks like job execution profiles can’t be created with my permission level.  Is this restricted to Milliman?

Hi Tom,
 
Or is the concern that you have Small / Medium / Large profiles already set up & working for other applications, that are different from what we suggest for i17? Yes, this is the concern.
 
If you can amend the scripts I can create the new execution profiles.
 
Thanks
Gareth

________________________________________
Matt, my note was meant to address those to 2 emails. In summary, the way IDM is set up is that each ETL in the script package has a profile (Small, Medium, Large) associated with it. In the release notes we also recommend the specs of the HDInsight clusters corresponding to each of those Small/Medium/Large clusters. That’s a setup that needs to happen for any implementation, but once it’s done there’s no re-profiling that needs to happen. 
 
Or is the concern that you have Small / Medium / Large profiles already set up & working for other applications, that are different from what we suggest for i17? If that is a concern I’d recommend setting up i17-specific clusters per the release notes (eg, i17_Small, i17_Med, i17_Large); it’d require a small amount of work for you to create the profiles in your environment & then for us to rename the profiles in our scripts, but that should be just a fairly small 1-time change.
 
Let me know if that makes sense, or if I’m not understanding the question. Thanks,

________________________________________
Mike, I had send the following note last week to Gareth & Matt that describes the setup of Execution profiles.
 
Gareth / Matt – can you confirm you got it, or if there are any questions? I fear my response might’ve inadvertently only gone to an internal distribution list.
__________________________________ 
 
Hi Matt / Gareth, attached please find the release notes that we provided with the script delivery. Exhibit 3 (Page 7) defines the execution profiles. Can you let us know if that’s different from what you were looking for? 
 
Please note there are a couple of potential revision items for future release notes though:
-          The document indicates HDInsight 3.6 clusters, which were relevant at the time, but I believe IDM only uses HDInsight 4.0 now.
-          Our team is still investigating ticket INC4156154. This could result in a change to the definition of one of the cluster types. We’ll let you know about that once the investigation is done.
 
Thanks and regards,

Hi Danial & Tom
 
Please see below. “ETL processes assigned to a given profile should be able to utilise the same settings without having to change the profile for specific processes”
 
Can you advise as to what developments are being applied to enable this for the IFRS 17 project.
 
@Rob, please could this be added as an agenda item for Tuesday’s planning meeting.
 
Regards
Mike

Hi Ishwar,
 
Thank you for the information.
 
It is slightly concerning and time consuming for us to have to manually change configuration on the cluster configuration to get the first process running and further individual IFRS17 IDM runs.
 
I think going forward, could Milliman provide a fix in the script/config to get the process working on D5_v2 cores, or create a new execution profile so that we don’t have to change it when running IFRS17 vs everything else.
 
Long term, I believe a solution or fix needs to be made via Milliman with instructions/release notes to reflect this, please keep us updated with any further progress.
 
Mike/Stefan/Rob/Gareth – Feel free to add anything further.
 
Kind regards
Matt

Can you advise as to what developments are being applied to enable this for the IFRS 17 project.
 
@Rob, please could this be added as an agenda item for Tuesday’s planning meeting.
 
Regards
Mike

In my opinion all ETL processes assigned to a given profile should be able to utilise the same settings without having to change the profile for specific processes.

Hi Ishwar,
 
Thank you for the information.
 
It is slightly concerning and time consuming for us to have to manually change configuration on the cluster configuration to get the first process running and further individual IFRS17 IDM runs.
 
I think going forward, could Milliman provide a fix in the script/config to get the process working on D5_v2 cores, or create a new execution profile so that we don’t have to change it when running IFRS17 vs everything else.
 
Long term, I believe a solution or fix needs to be made via Milliman with instructions/release notes to reflect this, please keep us updated with any further progress.
 
Mike/Stefan/Rob/Gareth – Feel free to add anything further.
 
Kind regards
Matt

Mike, I had send the following note last week to Gareth & Matt that describes the setup of Execution profiles.
 
Gareth / Matt – can you confirm you got it, or if there are any questions? I fear my response might’ve inadvertently only gone to an internal distribution list.
__________________________________ 
 
Hi Matt / Gareth, attached please find the release notes that we provided with the script delivery. Exhibit 3 (Page 7) defines the execution profiles. Can you let us know if that’s different from what you were looking for? 
 
Please note there are a couple of potential revision items for future release notes though:
-          The document indicates HDInsight 3.6 clusters, which were relevant at the time, but I believe IDM only uses HDInsight 4.0 now.
-          Our team is still investigating ticket INC4156154. This could result in a change to the definition of one of the cluster types. We’ll let you know about that once the investigation is done.
 
Thanks and regards,

Hi Paul,
 
These runs are no different to the SLAL stresses we’ve done throughout testing.  In this case though, the bottleneck is a lot more obvious because we can see the dependency requests for the scenario files on the separate testing not being fulfilled.
 
These runs use the TCF Deterministic template in MG-ALFA, running 880 jobsteps in 11 workspaces (so 9,680 jobsteps) and the TCF Stochastic template, running 268 jobsteps in 11 workspaces (another 2,948 jobsteps).  These are large volumes relative to heritage Phoenix, so there’s an internal discussion to be had about whether we can cut down the number of results files per jobstep, but I’d also be interested to know if anything can be done to accommodate these volumes on the DEI.
 
Thanks
Gareth

Hi Gareth,

Thanks.

Would it be possible for you to provide some extra detail on how these runs and different from previous ones.

We can tell from the logs that there is a massive amount of payloads and think if we could understand the runs a little bit better that this might help with our interna discussions.

Thanks,

Hi Gareth, 

On review of the system, the DEI is still processing through a backlog of messages(result payloads as you observed) to send through to the Phoenix SAS. 

The dependency/associated messages for the highlighted workspaces are yet to be processed and sent by the DEI which has not yet got to these workspace related messages, as these were created and queued after the results messages that the DEI is working through currently. 

It is therefore the DEI rather than IFP where the delay is being observed - once the DEI processes through the queue of results it should get to and send through the dependency requests you are currently waiting on.

I am discussing this further internally but if there is any further feedback/questions from your side in the meantime please let me know. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections (https://t2-pre.mgalfacompute.com)

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 4.

Issue Description:

Summary: TCF model run results are still being processed by the T2 DEI 3 days after the model run completed
Environment: T2
Severity: 4
Reporting period: 12/2020
Valuation activity: No (IMOR Cycle 2)
Workspace affected: See below
Jobstep affected: See below
Data mart affected: N/a
Relevant inputs: See below

Detailed description: When running SLAL stresses in MG-ALFA (which use the TCF Deterministic and TCF Stochastic MG-ALFA templates) we observe that it takes a very long time for IFP and DEI to process the results.  For example, we started a full set of such runs in T2 on the evening of 19 July 2021 and the DEI is still processing the results files.  As a specific example, the following results file was transferred via the DEI at 0739 on 23 July after completing in Compute at 0658 on 20 July.

Workspace: 2020Q4_IMOR_TCF_Cycle2DetVA_SLHWNP_20210712_R0075
Jobstep: NZU
Output: Rreq.307:Scn.000 (616cf3dc20c048898b82b459a9e28ac7)

As a result, workspaces started on 20 July have dependency requests that are still waiting to be fulfilled from files in SAS.  Specficially, the scenario file depency requests from these workspaces have not yet been processed:

2020Q4_IMOR_S2P1_Cycle1InvRisk2p1_SLUKSM_20210720_R0380
2020Q4_IMOR_S2P1_Cycle1InvRisk2p1_SLHWWP_20210720_R0381
2020Q4_IMOR_S2P1_Cycle1InvRisk2p1_SLGWP_20210720_R0382

And results files from a set of 29 workspaces started on 22 July, including 2020Q4_IMOR_S2P1_Cycle2IMHValn_PLL100_20210721_R0142, have not been received.

The large number of jobsteps within the SLAL stress workspaces, and associated number of results files, is presumably causing a bottleneck that I’d like to better understand (and discuss options to mitigate).

As a first step, can you observe where the bottleneck is?  My assumption is IFP (currently scaled to 30 workers) or the DEI.


Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.

Subject: SAS Password reset

Hello

I need to change my SAS password periodically from here S:\Password-Setup\Password-Setup password
On this occasion I was able to change my password ""successfully"" but it was then followed by a ""system error"" message when it tried 
to connect (I think it was error code 1326) which presumably means I don't have access to the server in question. Can you investigate please?

Thanks

Good afternoon Jess,

After liaising with our Tier 2 team, we have identified that these runs are using a projection key override on pk.S2_DMA_Ded in IFP, and this key is used by IDM to assign a stress name. 

The override is not expected, so it doesn't exist within the IDM mapping and therefore all of the jobsteps here are being dropped.

These kind of defects are usually dealt with by adding the necessary info to the mapping table in the next IDM release.

Does this help explain why the extracts are not being produced?

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Hi Vishal, 
 
I’ve also checked within the workspaces to see if any of these jobsteps produce the Inv 330 output and it doesn’t look like they do, so it doesn’t concern me that the table status here is 0. 
 
There are results included in the extracts for the other workspaces which also do not have any Inv330 outputs, but not the two new workspaces we’ve ran recently. 
 
We also had an initial error trying to load these workspaces into IDM under ticket reference 95180, and so we added the additional set of workspaces to cover Amrit’s suggestion: 
 
In order to workaround the issue, one quick fix would be to re-run Step1 and include even just a single job-step which produces Inv321 or 322 for the legacy job-steps
 
Kind Regards,
Jess

Morning Vishal, 
 
My apologies for that, the original ETL link I sent was for the first workflow set up which was later cancelled. 
 
Please use the following ETL for further investigation: https://t1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=92dcbe21562b4c12afc84eaed60a04e8 apologies for this oversight in the original email.

Hi Jess,

On initial investigation I noticed that the data version of the Step1 workflow does not match the Step1 ETL or the Step2 Workflow. 

If this is intentional, could you please provide some context around why the data version changed?

Step1 ETL:
 

Step2 Workflow:

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections https://t1.mgalfacloud.com
• Integrate Data Management https://idm-t1.mgalfacloud.com


Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 3.

Issue Description:
An IDM load has completed successfully for the above workspaces, along with a number of other workspaces. The project have tested specific overrides in these workspaces and are now loading them into IDM. The other workspaces within the list seen in the Step 1 workflow (https://t1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=df627b82fb0a42289c0e755777e9f107) have loaded successfully, and the outputs can be seen within the IDM extracts created. The two workspaces listed above have failed to produce any data within the extracts even though they have completed successfully and appear to have loaded correctly in IDM. This is the first time we’ve ran workspaces with these settings so we have nothing to compare back to with a successful IDM load. Is it possible to investigate the cause of the missing data from within the extracts produced?

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.

We are working to resolve this issue. If any of the above does not align with your expectations around this ticket, please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, amending your ticket through our web-based portal (http://support.integrate-solutions.com), or by emailing support@integrate-solutions.com.

Tom, Danial, Jay, Ishwar
 
Please could you provide an update on progress.
 
As you are aware this is preventing us delivering nay results from Test Cycle 1 which is impacting the wider IFRS 17 project.
 
We can see some ETL jobs on B3 which have been cancelled

No Problem Matt,

This has been escalated to our tier 2 team who are continuing to investigate. 

To troubleshoot this further the tier 2 team will be debugging and potentially running the individual transform that was encountering the issue in B3. Please let us know if there are any concerns/questions with this.

Hi Matt, Gareth,

Thank you for advising why the profiles are configured the same. 

In discussion with the tier 2 team, they have confirmed this second part ETL requires does need to run on a larger cluster size. 

Based on previous successful runs of this ETL in the T4 environment they have advised for the Large Execution Profile, which is used by this second ETL to be updated via the 'configure' option highlighted below to use D5_v2 node sizes with 15 workers. Once updated please attempt a re-run and feel free to cancel the failing run as it will not complete. 

https://idm-b3.mgalfacloud.com/#/executionprofiles 

 

To confirm, the initial job which was under investigation on ticket 95377/INC4148709 only required the Medium profile to be updated - apologies this was not confirmed from our side at the time.

Please let us know once the Large profile change has been made and the re-run started for us to monitor the run from our side. If there are any questions please let us know. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

The Small, Medium and Large execution profiles are set to the same size because I didn’t know what profile the initial job that was failing used.

Hi Matt,

On investigation, I've identified that the transform which is currently in progress on this ETL has failed and retried multiple attempts resulting in the longer than expected runtime. Based on the errors encountered I believe the cause is related to the cluster size being used on this second ETL and I'm currently verifying this internally. 

On initial look, the first ETL in the process which now completes successfully uses the Medium Execution Profile while the second part of the ETL is set to use the configured size for the Large Execution Profile. 

Both Medium and Large profiles in B3 are however currently configured to use the same size and it is likely that we'll need to update the Large cluster profile with different settings which I am confirming.

 

I will keep you updated with further details on next steps. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Hi Gareth

We have identified the incident occured due to a slow node. We have re-injected the tasks running on the faulty node from the back end. We are aware of the issue and the latest release of Compute has more monitoring in place to identify the issue earlier.

Hi Gareth,

I wanted to follow up on this ticket as I wanted to check a couple of things.

1) What if any testing will be taking place before these runs with the H8 grids are ran in Production?
2) What core amount is likely to be needed for a) Testing if any and then b) Production.

Thanks,

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for advising.

Looking at Ishwar's investigations, we can advise that the H8m node type looks to be most appropriate.

The H8m machine type is an 8 core node, allowing for up to 14GB of memory per task and up to 125GB of disk space per task, which based on the runs we monitored, would be sufficient to allow the tasks to run without resource constraint. 

Please let me know if you have any follow up concerns or queries with this.

Kind regards,

Hi Gareth,

I am picking this ticket up whilst Ishwar is out of office. We have been discussing this internally and whilst we can suggest larger VM sizes, we would first recommend that the data/modelling team investigating this internally before we provide new, larger hardware options. 

If the data/modelling team are able to confirm that these outputs aren't asking for more than they expected to receive and aren't producing larger than expected results, we can then look into suggesting larger hardware. 

We recommend this approach, as it saves Phoenix running on larger, more costly node types, if the runs may not necessarily need them after being reviewed.

Please advise if you feel this is a viable next step, or if you have any concerns or queries with the above.

Kind regards,
Vishal Tween

Hi Jessica,

Thank you for your patience whilst we gathered the details. 

From our review of the re-run I suspect that the original run encountered errors (unexpected task reschedules), due to the node it was executing on running out of disk space. If a node does run out of disk space, it will typically result in any tasks which were executing on the node to unexpectedly reschedule and for the node to potentially enter an unusable state.  

Whilst monitoring the BPM workspace re-run (jobsteps 851 and 901), where we re-injected both jobsteps to run on same node, we observed the free disk space on the node drop to ~50GB out of 200 GB after around 3 days of both jobsteps executing. 

Looking back at the errored run,  it was after approximately 2.5 days where the node encountered the issue. In addition to the 2 jobsteps from the workspace highlighted originally on this ticket, there was however also the 3rd jobstep below from a separate workspace,  that was identified as running simultaneously on the same node from the 27th - 30th July. 

If this 3rd jobstep was of similar size, this would based on the disk space used by the re-run likely have been enough to exhaust the disk space on the node and subsequently cause unexpected task reschedules. 

Jobstep: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/JobStep/Details?workspaceId=90752e33da1241a2a7332f676f1ab3b2&jobStepId=901

The latest node metrics recorded in our logging around the time errors started, indicated that the available disk space on the node was at only ~4GB(out of 200GB) on the 30th July at 7:38am.  

This is shortly prior to the highlighted period below, where the errored jobstep initially rescheduled and the node was then unable to successfully restart the task, as it may have become unusable when disk space had become depleted.

https://b1-pre.mgalfacompute.com/JobInfo/Details/7424e77c-293d-4d00-98d7-dff16a112db9 

 

There are larger VM sizes(with increased cost) available that offer more disk space, which on request we could make available to use, should this continue to be an issue on any further executions of these workspaces specifically.  

Please let us know if there are any follow up questions or concerns.

Hi Jessica,

For our troubleshooting, we have re-injected the jobsteps from this workspace so that each of them are running on separate nodes, whilst also leaving the first submissions which are running on the same node for our troubleshooting. 

This is to help determine if this was a factor in the errors encountered on the original run where multiple jobsteps were executing on the same node at the time of the errors.  

Please let us know if you have any questions/concerns regarding this.  

Kind Regards,

Hi Ishwar, 
 
We’ve now set up and started the new BPM workspace and would appreciate if this workspace could be monitored to see if it is affected by the same errors seen within the previous workspace attempt.
 
Workspace is: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=ca25badd54a64045a797be087399552c
 
Many Thanks, 
Jess

Hi Jessica,

On initial investigation of our logs, jobstep 901 appeared to have been processing normally until it encountered unexpected reschedules on the 30th July from which it was unable to recover.  

Jobstep 851 from this same workspace(2021Q2_Valn_BPM_Base_SLHWWP_20210719_R0252) did also encounter similar unexpected reschedules at the same time as 901, however 851 eventually recovered after a few retries, whereas 901 exhausted all retry limits causing the error. Both of these jobsteps notably also encountered these reschedules whilst running on the same node.

The logs captured and reviewed thus far have not identified the cause of these reschedules and with access to the running node no longer available, as the grid scaled down, it will be difficult to further troubleshoot to isolate/confirm what the issue may have been e.g if it was a node specific problem or potentially resource related due to both of these jobsteps running simultaneously on the same node.  

To troubleshoot this further it would be helpful for Milliman to investigate a live running instances of the jobstep, however depending on the expected time for completion for this run, kicking off a re-run now may result in it completing or encountering the same issue over the weekend and us losing the node again.  In which case we would then request another re-run be initiated next week to monitor/review the job over support hours.

Please let us know if you'd prefer to proceed with a re-run attempt or if Phoenix are also happy to do so, re-run the jobstep on Monday morning for example to allow it be investigated by Milliman during support hours. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections (https://website.mgalfacloud.com)

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 3, which is our default.

Issue Description:
Summary:   BPM JS901 completed with errors


Environment:    B1 Pre-Prod
Severity:     3  
Reporting Period:   06/2021
Valuation Activity:   Yes      
Workflow Affected: https://idm-b1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b1-preproduction%7C%7C3d0d8176-5265-4188-84e5-af813c5341bc

Workspaces Affected:   https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=9d3fa644200341449fceaa3ddeb14f52
Jobsteps Affected:      901
Relevant inputs:     Inputs received         

Detailed Description:  As part of the Q2 reporting we’ve ran BPM for the SLAL funds, but JS 901 in the workspace 2021Q2_Valn_BPM_Base_SLHWWP_20210719_R0252 has completed with errors and is now preventing us from loading the full set of BPM results into IDM.
A workspace within the same environment, using the same model but different inputs completed successfully here: https://b1.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=3a75e3a365c341e4a34b1438a4d1b7f2
Is it possible to investigate why this workspace has completed with errors so we can rerun if required and enable us to load the relevant workspaces into IDM?

Hi Jethro and Jess,

I have just ran this job locally and I can confirm it also  fails when running on my desktop so this does seem to be a model/data issue and not system related.

Error when ran locally:

 

I have spoken to Bruce and I believe the next step is for Phoenix to package a desktop version up and ask for this to be investigated further by Milliman but not via this ticket.

I will mark this call as resolved as this is not system related, however if you disagree or wish to discuss further then please do not hesitate to contact me or reply to this email.

Hello,
 
I note there is an existing Finance Incident FINC004935 “IMOR Cycle2 - Exploding BEL in SLHWWP TCF run” opened on 28/07 where investigation from Bruce Keenan has identified an issue within the model being used here in T2 - Valuation_11.4.2028_2021.RC.01.01
 
“Problem is on Proj.SJE and simulation 988 for SLHWWP in the Stochastic TCF runs”
 
It seems a coincidence as it’s also Sim 988 so can someone at Milliman please confirm if that model issue would have caused this cloud error?
 
Kind regards,
Jethro

Hi Jessica,

Can you confirm if this issue has been investigated locally as the error message is pointing towards a model/date issue and not a system issue:
Model error:

Service(s) Impacted:
• MG-ALFA Compute for Azure  https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/ 

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 3, which is our default.

Issue Description:

Detailed Description: The workspace above has been ran as part of testing, and during review we’ve found that  the full stochastic run has only produced results for 1000 of the 1001 sims (Sim988 is missing) and produces the following model error:
Model error:
=== [989\model.err] ===
2183(E): mLiab GetUdfValue function returned bad result.  Function: CMLIAB01 at (y,m)=(25,205).

ERROR: ahost.exe with arguments "". . model.cmd 989 -f ""s 988 1001"""" completed with exit code: -529697949
Is it possible to investigate the reasoning behind this error, at present this issue has an affect on the cloud results itself but will also affect the IDM results loaded for further review.

Jess

Hi Tom
 
This is immensely frustrating to be told mid-way through the test cycle, that the process has changed to use a single scalar file rather than as in 2020 separate new business and in force files
 
If I understand Danial correctly, we are to supply one scalar file that contains both new business at the previous year end and inforce business at the current valuation date and store this is in the DEI location linked to the new business run at the previous year end
 
Regards
Mike

Mike, 
 
Just to clarify an item:
 
“for the DEI Inputs for the New Business at 12/2019, but run at 12/2018 and the In force business at 12/2019 to be in the same”
 
It needs to be in the same .txt file and not the same folder. DEI folder can only accept one scalar and vector file. 
 
Just a quick example from my testing. I use this .txt file as part of 12/2019 NB run and the 03/2020 IF run:
 
 
 
Happy to discuss this over a call shortly if you would like.

Subject: RE: Milliman Support Request: INC4163179: NEW INCIDENT: B3 IVM New Business Workspaces Failing
 
Hi Danial
 
Thanks for your help.
 
Regards your final point – for the DEI Inputs for the New Business at 12/2019, but run at 12/2018 and the In force business at 12/2019 to be in the same folder, am I correct that the Sys.Dataversion for all the workspaces and workflows for both NB and IF also needs to be the same?
This is contrary to the footnote at the bottom of page 13 in ""2020 IFRS17 Phase 1 - Integrate Configuration - v05"" which states ""Note that [the Sys.DataVersion for New Business Initialisation] will be different from the Sys.DataVersion used in the all business IVM"". 
Please confirm ASAP to enable us to begin re-configuration
[DK] No it doesn’t have to be the same. However, we have dedicated IFP publish ETLs for New Bus and Subsequent runs and the Valuation dates of these would be different as well. So even if the sys.dataversion key is same, we will have other metadata that will be different and it will work.  Apologies, if I didn’t understand your question properly but in short, it is always safe to have different sys,dataversion key for each workflow. 
 
As to your second point, I was aware that we did not have ENTPLAL new business, but why would this lead to an ‘empty’ MPF – does the DEI filter the scalar file in to Entity specific files? Could this and other specifics of the system be include in expanded configuration documentation from Milliman.
[DK] It is just how IDM works with Model point files. I believe the technical term here is “Partition Transform”. If the data is not there for a certain entity [ENTPLAL in this case], there is no way for IDM to know that it needs to publish MPF for ENTPLAL. Running with an empty MPF is the same as not running ENTPLAL NB workspace at all. Can that be an option for TC1?   I can include this as part of expanded configuration. 
 
 
Finally, as to your first point, I feel this is a change of approach from 2020 Wave 1, but cannot be sure. As such @Fab, please note for new business scalar file, the internal valuation date needs to be that of the previous year end (reflecting the MPF etc.).
[DK] Unsure if I my input was needed here.   
 
 
 
Regards
Mike

Hi Mike, 
 
Few things to note here for following ETL:
https://idm-b3.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/b3-preproduction%7C%7Cb6d92396-98cf-4015-ac12-4d585e44d233
 
·         I downloaded the DEI inputs used here and I see the Valuation Date used is 12/2019. I would expect it to be 12/2018.
o   IDM is unable to find records at 12/2018 to publish. 
o   Unlike factor files, IDM cannot upload/publish empty Model Point files to IFP and therefore IFRS17 New Bus workspace won’t start.
 
·         Also, I see you sent some screenshots for ENTPLAL and PLG workspaces IVM. Just to note, the scalar inputs you have added has PLG and ENTPLL. So even if the valuation data in the DEI input, was correct ENTPLAL wouldn’t have started as IDM doesn’t publish empty model point file and workspace dependency wouldn’t have been met. 
 
·         Lastly, I see the DEI inputs are only New Bus inputs. I would expect the inputs would consist of the following two:
o   Dummy NewBus data at 12/2018
o   Subsequent data at 12/2019
§  Because there is no 12/2019 subsequent data currently in the DEI inputs, you will face similar problems when the time comes to run 12/2019 subsequent run.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Paul
I've cc'd Tom Kim and Danial Kherani who are the Milliman SMEs on IFRS 17 that PHX has been working with.
As you point out, the workspaces are waiting for the liability input. This is supplied as a scalar file in the DEI and uploaded via a workflow. The configuration information supplied by Milliman is attached ""2020 IFRS17 Phase 1 - Integrate Configuration - v05""
The workflow to upload the inputs from the DEI associated with these workspaces is:
https://b3.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=be2c99d89e4842ea9fd09921a1eb748a
I have also compared a successful workflow and workspace combination from T4.
https://t4.mgalfacloud.com/JobStep/Details?workspaceId=352baa0466494419a3621f265f7d9fc9&jobStepId=001
https://t4.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowStepDetails?workflowId=c54fe40ec3db421394f45e79db94bf88&workflowStepId=21
I have included the comparisons as T4_DEIinputs_IVMws_cf_Wkflw and b3_DEIinputs_IVMws_cf_Wkflw for B3
From this I note that in T4 the values match between workspace and workflow for i17.OutputVersion and i17.WSKey
This is not the case for B3, though nor it is a specified requirement in the configuration document.
The other discrepancy I note, is that in T4 for the workspace i17.WSType is set to ""VALN"" whereas, as sepcified, in B3 for the workspaces this is set ot ""VALNNB""
Please keep us informed of the progress of your investigation

Hi Paul,
 
That’s correct, I believe the scaler file for the IVM workspaces produces this and this is present.
 
The IVM workspaces work slightly different to how we usually run and pick up files in the normal workspaces we run.
 
@ Mike can you expand further please to Paul to provide anything I may have missed, Or a more in-depth detail for Paul and Milliman’s understanding.
 
Kind regards
Matt

Hi Matt,

I have looked at those workspaces and I can see that the liabilities file is missing form the workspaces and this is why they have not started.

 

Can you please provide further details on what workspace/ETL process produced this file please?

Hi Gareth, 

The issues observed on this ticket were related to the throttling of the IFP storage issue discussed externally, which is an issue being targeted by the IFP patch deployment tomorrow. 

The high storage load during the highlighted jobstep submissions and the workspaces startups, resulted in errors which impacted these processes, resulting in the issues which occurred. 

Please let us know if you have any follow up questions/concerns for this incident. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

The replacement ETL has now been started: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C12eb6771-b99d-46fa-be59-ca3c68589f27.
 
Unfortunately one of the replacement jobs doesn’t appear to have reached Compute:

Thanks Ishwar,
 
I’ve cancelled the ETL process and we’ll set up a replacement.
 
Two workspaces have been started to replace the ones affected by the overload issue:
https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=33a2b183ee3d4a3b85539f3410b245e4
https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=08c115fba4384948997eb4e5020eab07
 
Based on the current view in Ops Manager, they appear to be ok this time.

Hi Jessica,

The HAX jobstep has been re-injected and now completed successfully. 

The loading of the workspace inputs for the below ETL is not however proceeding as this process is waiting on the 2 of the workspaces selected below to start in IFP -  these 2 workspaces however have encountered an issue which has prevented them from starting successfully. 

ETL: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C09f0a456-2bc8-41d3-a142-9a8049553894 

Workspaces which failed to start: 
https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=6fcf32498da94d79b2acc0d78f2f5364 
https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=8a5c339f995f4fefb006504b22d9a603 

To unblock these 2 workspaces which have failed to start/submit jobsteps, we would recommend they be copied and attempted to be started again if they have not been already. 

This will not unblock the above ETL which already has the above 2 failed workspaces selected, and this ETL will therefore need to be recreated to include the replacement workspaces for the above 2 which failed to start. 

The issue which impacted the startup of these 2 workspaces as well as the HAX jobstep submission was the same issue for which Milliman sent a notification yesterday(from Paul Beasmore) for 2 other T2 workspaces which failed to start.  This has been raised to our tier 3 team who are working on fixes to prevent such issues from occuring when the environment is under a particularly heavy load. 

Apologies for the inconvenience/delay this has caused. Please let us know if there are any questions. 

Kind Regards,
Ishwar Johal

Hi Tom,
 
This is the 12/2019 Initialise new data mart & get prior GDS output workflow we have just started: ETL: INTEGRATE™ (mgalfacloud.com)
 
If this completes successfully, I will be kicking off the next workflow: 2019Q4_2020.11_v04_IFRS17TC1_IFsbsq_Step5_R0291 Milliman Integrate (mgalfacloud.com)
 
I will provide the ETL once kicked off, hope this helps.

Thanks for that update Matt. We believe all of the transforms have already been hit by now, so should be ok to proceed with the next valuation dates.
 
If you like you can send us links to any newly kicked-off workflows, and we can try to pop in periodically to see if anything looks unusual.

Hi Tom,
 
I am pleased to say the replacement has worked, following Danial’s fix.
 
Are we confident  now with the fixes in place, these errors will not happen when we come to running 12/2019 and 03/2021 workflows?

________________________________________
It doesn’t appear that it is quite the same issue as in INC4148709, but we were able to identify a memory capacity problem when applying a particular transform to a very large number of columns (1320) that appear in our DEI Vector input.
 
Danial has re-configured the i17_Large execution profile on B3 to use higher memory capacity hardware & confirmed that the ETL now completes successfully. So I think you’ll just need to restart your workflow.
 
For further background unfortunately there appears to be some stale documentation in the release notes – the cluster size indicated for the large profile was a remnant of the Wave 1 work (back when we didn’t have these DEI Vector input loads) & the actual specs that we used in successful T4 testing were consistent with the new i17_Large profile that is now in B3. We’ll send an update to the release notes on Tuesday that documents both the new i17-specific execution profiles as well as the updated hardware specifications. (You won’t need to do any setup for those, since that has already been done).

Mike, Danial is currently running a test to confirm whether this is the same issue as what we saw last week for INC4148709 (except this time with Inception/Subsequent instead of Transition). Will let you know more details once that test is done.

Thanks for that update Matt. We believe all of the transforms have already been hit by now, so should be ok to proceed with the next valuation dates.
 
If you like you can send us links to any newly kicked-off workflows, and we can try to pop in periodically to see if anything looks unusual.

Hi Tom,
 
I am pleased to say the replacement has worked, following Danial’s fix.
 
Are we confident  now with the fixes in place, these errors will not happen when we come to running 12/2019 and 03/2021 workflows?
 
Kind regards
Matt

It doesn’t appear that it is quite the same issue as in INC4148709, but we were able to identify a memory capacity problem when applying a particular transform to a very large number of columns (1320) that appear in our DEI Vector input.
 
Danial has re-configured the i17_Large execution profile on B3 to use higher memory capacity hardware & confirmed that the ETL now completes successfully. So I think you’ll just need to restart your workflow.
 
For further background unfortunately there appears to be some stale documentation in the release notes – the cluster size indicated for the large profile was a remnant of the Wave 1 work (back when we didn’t have these DEI Vector input loads) & the actual specs that we used in successful T4 testing were consistent with the new i17_Large profile that is now in B3. We’ll send an update to the release notes on Tuesday that documents both the new i17-specific execution profiles as well as the updated hardware specifications. (You won’t need to do any setup for those, since that has already been done).

Mike, Danial is currently running a test to confirm whether this is the same issue as what we saw last week for INC4148709 (except this time with Inception/Subsequent instead of Transition). Will let you know more details once that test is done.

Hi Gareth,

These 3 jobsteps have been re-submitted and have now completed. 

They encountered a known defect(reference 9084) which prevented the jobs status from updating to Complete once it had finished processing. A fix for this issue was included in the 2021.04 Compute release. 

Please let us know if you have any follow up questions.

Hi Gareth

We have investigated the issue and concluded that the tasks are running on a slow node. We can re-inject the job, which will mean that all 12,000 tasks will need to be re-run, or we can requeue the running 8 tasks on another node.

Please let us know what you would prefer?

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections (https://t2.mgalfacloud.com)
• Integrate Data Management (https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com)

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 3, which is our default.

Issue Description:
Summary: Job 6988f is running longer than expected and may have encountered a Compute issue
Environment: T2-pre
Severity: 3
Reporting period: 06/2021
Valuation activity: No (IMOR DR6)
Workspace affected: 2021Q2_IMOR_DR6_LSMC_40kOutx12in40Bat_PearlWP_20210809_R0398 (https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workspace/Details?workspaceId=ec19eb50c3b24173ad78cd40e2be3254)
Jobstep affected: 107 (6988f113-aafc-41f7-9f57-41d8cfb89dc9)
ETL job affected: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C59a19cf3-f3a1-4212-8b8a-1376b61fcfbb
Data mart affected: GDSKey = 2021Q2_IMOR_DR6_LSMC_Main_PHX
Relevant inputs: N/a

Detailed description: The above job has been running for around 11 hours and 8 of the tasks have not yet completed.  Looking at other jobs within the same workspace, total runtime is around 7.5 hours.  And looking at the task log, the last job to complete was at 23:11, with each task taking less than 30 minutes.  This suggests a Compute issue is affecting the remaining 8 tasks, which will need investigating.  This is preventing an LSMC ETL process in IDM from progressing.

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working. Following resolution of this issue, we will provide you a closing summary noting the work completed and the workaround or solution provided.

We are working to resolve this issue. If any of the above does not align with your expectations around this ticket, please let us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, amending your ticket through our web-based portal (http://support.integrate-solutions.com), or by emailing support@integrate-solutions.com.

I can see that the jobsteps with the updated component have since completed without task errors. 

Could you please advise if this has unblocked the issue for this run or if there are any further concerns requiring assistance?

Hi Ishwar,
 
We’ve started a replacement workflow: 2021Q2_DR6_2021.RC_V01_LSMC_MainRun3_20210812_F0007
Calibration ETL: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C76a5584d-5b20-4733-b519-efb6c1c9235c
 
There are a number of jobs uploading workspace inputs, and this seems to be causing contention, so it might be a while before the regression steps start.
 
Janet

Good Morning Janet, 

The LsRegressAggregator.2.1.1.44.zip build has now been set as the default LsmcRegression component in T2.  Could you please attempt a re-run with this updated component build and provide a URL once started?

Hi Janet,

This would not require any downtime and is quite a quick and simple item to enable.

Happy yo make this change but I would need a Phoenix approver to give their approval.

Once we get this approval we will make the change.

Thanks for letting us know, Ishwar.
 
Can you advise if deploying the new version of LsRegressAggregator would require any downtime?
 
If not, I’d be inclined to deploy version LsRegressAggregator.2.1.1.44.zip and attempt a rerun.
 
Many thanks,
 
Janet

Hi Janet,

To provide an update, on comparison of the 2 workflows below I can see that the successful run in T1 utilized a different version of the LsmcRegression component(LsRegressAggregator.2.1.1.44.zip) verses the run in T2 which is producing these errors(LsRegressAggregator.2.1.1.27.zip). 

T2 Workflow: https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=ab3408005cee46198158cda52ac90ee3 
T1 Workflow: https://t1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=a7279629419248139fcb0650308f29c6 
 
I am verifying this difference with our tier 2 team as potentially related to the cause of the error,  but thought I would highlight this in the meantime for your reference in case this later version of the component is already a known requirement by Phoenix for this particular run. 

Please note the LsRegressAggregator.2.1.1.44.zip version of the LsmcRegression is not currently available to select in the T2 environment as Milliman would require a request from Phoenix either via this ticket or separately such as via PHXR0031056/ #88110 to make this available in this environment. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ishwar Johal

Hi Ishwar,
 
We’ve tried rerunning the workflow, having removed the extra (ERM) rows from the ConfigData file, but the issue with the regression steps failing remains.
 
Latest workflow is: 2021Q2_DR6_2021.RC_V01_LSMC_MainRun2_20210811_F0006
ETL:  https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C70085883-e3e9-4e6d-bcbe-c335645ba4ae

Thanks Paul.
 
We didn’t observe anything unusual with the ConfigData header, but the project team are checking the tool that generates these input files.
 
I think the project are planning to try a desktop NAVI run, and we may also rerun the cloud workflow, removing the extra rows that were introduced for DR6 in case they have caused the issue.

Thanks Janet,

Appreciate that the logs are not the most helpful but I was hoping that the error message that Ishwar gave would assist, copied below:

[11:52:18][INFO]

[11:52:18][ERROR] There was a problem validating file: .\801516e0f1154c3191a6b43f3573d502; Data File has Invalid number of header columns.
What we can do is escalate this to our tier 2 and 3 teams to see if they have any thoughts or input around the error message.

We will escalate and get back to you over the next couple of days.

Please let me know if the project team find anything out whilst they carry out their investigations.

Hi Paul,
 
We appreciate this is potentially a data issue, but as we don’t have access to the cloud logs and the error message we can see is less than helpful it’s very difficult for us to do any meaningful  investigation.
 
I believe there is a Desktop NAVI tool, but don’t expect this will work in quite the same way as the cloud version.  Nevertheless, this is perhaps something the project team can explore.
 
We have previously used a version of the ConfigData file in DR5 testing (12/2020) – see:  https://idm-t1.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t1-preproduction%7C%7C91b43779-b19b-4d79-a5c0-a1fb9077741a .  The header record appears to be consistent with the file we’re using for DR6.
 
For DR6 ValDate and ConfigVarName have been amended to reflect the 06/2021 valuation period, and 7 additional rows are included (at the end of the file).
 
DR5 used script IDM_Output_2021.RB_V02, whereas DR6 is using IDM_Output_2021.RC_V01.
 
Any further assistance you can provide will be much appreciated.
 
Many thanks,
 
Janet

Hi Janet,

Thanks for the reply and we will look into this further where possible but this is currently not pointing to a system issue and more a data/model issue.

Has this model been ran locally and investigated further?

Have you got examples were this has worked previously?

And if so what has changed from working examples to this latest one?

Thanks,

Hi Ishwar,
 
The project team have checked the ConfigData file, and can find no issues in the header format.  
 
The ValDate , and ConfigVarName reflect the 2021Q2 valuation period, but otherwise it appears to be consistent with the file we used successfully in DR5 testing.
 
Can you please investigate further?  Until we understand the issue in more detail we are unable to correct the file, and this is impacting our DR6 working day timetable.
 
Many thanks,
 
Janet

The third I didn’t trust to complete the slow download of workspace data so a replacement was set up, which is running a few hours behind:

Hi Ishwar,
 
These three ETLs are now running:
 
https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7Ce9cfa99c-6e97-4d2a-9155-13d9833c4121

It looks like the first has a failed Download Workspace Table Output job, so I may have to re-run it.

Hi Gareth, 

Could you please attempt to run each workspace in a separate datamart.

Please let us know once attempted and we will monitor the progress of the ETLs from our side.

Hi,
 
Is there any update on the best way we might split the load?  I have run three workspaces now (each containing roughly a third of the jobsteps).  My attempt to load these into a single, new data mart appears to have failed: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C9f737a2a-7fa5-49f5-b4cd-3eaf78f875b4.  I can attempt to load them into three separate data marts.
 
Thanks
Gareth

Afternoon,
 
Is there any update on how we might get 2021Q2_DR6_S2P1_IMHManuals_PLLNP_20210804_R0350 into IDM?
 
To work around the issue of volumes we were considering splitting the workspace into 2 (or more parts) and loading them to IDM (in either 1 or more data marts)?  I assume this would work, but do you have an idea of how many workspaces I’d need to split it into?

Thanks Ishwar
 
After speaking to the Tier 2 team last night the original job was cancelled and a replacement (excluding the specified workspace) has now completed: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C1a564ffa-47c1-45e0-9402-579c6570c46f.
 
We will await further updates.

Good Morning Gareth,

From our investigations into the issue and we can see that the size of the behind the scenes files which move data is causing certain size limits to be breached, preventing the 15_LiabNPVAll transform from completing. 

We are continuing to look into a solution for this but in the meantime our tier 2 team have suggested removing the below workspace from the run should allow this job to complete.

2021Q2_DR6_S2P1_IMHManuals_PLLNP_20210804_R0350

Thank you for your patience whilst we continue our investigations. Please let us know if there are any questions in the meantime. 

Kind Regards,

Hi Ishwar,
 
When deleting the duplicate HDInsight clusters that get produced with long running jobs like this one I accidentally clicked start rather than delete.  The cluster started but there doesn’t seem to be an option to stop it.  Can you stop and delete HDInsight cluster IFP Job 12eb6771-b99d-46fa-be59-ca3c68589f27?
 
To be clear the correct HDInsight cluster for this job is IFP Job 12eb6771-b99d-46fa-be59-ca3c68589f27 (auto-started), and that shouldn’t be stopped.
 
In the snip below, it’s the second cluster that we want stopped:
 
 
 
Thanks
Gareth

Hi Gareth,

We are currently investing the transform which is failing to complete alongside our  tier 2 team. To progress the investigation our tier 2 team would like perform test executions of this single transform in the T2 environment to troubleshoot the issue further.  

Could you please advise if you are happy to approve this transform execution by our tier 2 team in T2 IDM as part of this investigation? Please let us know if there are any questions regarding this request.

Hi Gareth,

As an update, we have identified a potential error since my previous update on the currently running transform and are investigating this further. 

We will provide further updates as they become available. A previous run of this script/similar data size may still be helpful for our investigation if it is available.

Thanks for that update Matt. We believe all of the transforms have already been hit by now, so should be ok to proceed with the next valuation dates.
 
If you like you can send us links to any newly kicked-off workflows, and we can try to pop in periodically to see if anything looks unusual.

Hi Tom,
 
I am pleased to say the replacement has worked, following Danial’s fix.
 
Are we confident  now with the fixes in place, these errors will not happen when we come to running 12/2019 and 03/2021 workflows?
 
Kind regards

________________________________________
It doesn’t appear that it is quite the same issue as in INC4148709, but we were able to identify a memory capacity problem when applying a particular transform to a very large number of columns (1320) that appear in our DEI Vector input.
 
Danial has re-configured the i17_Large execution profile on B3 to use higher memory capacity hardware & confirmed that the ETL now completes successfully. So I think you’ll just need to restart your workflow.
 
For further background unfortunately there appears to be some stale documentation in the release notes – the cluster size indicated for the large profile was a remnant of the Wave 1 work (back when we didn’t have these DEI Vector input loads) & the actual specs that we used in successful T4 testing were consistent with the new i17_Large profile that is now in B3. We’ll send an update to the release notes on Tuesday that documents both the new i17-specific execution profiles as well as the updated hardware specifications. (You won’t need to do any setup for those, since that has already been done).

Mike, Danial is currently running a test to confirm whether this is the same issue as what we saw last week for INC4148709 (except this time with Inception/Subsequent instead of Transition). Will let you know more details once that test is done.

Detailed description: The above subsequent measurement IVM workspaces have been started this morning, but has unfortunately they appear to have not started. This appears to have failed on picking up the factor files, namely  100, 120 and 150.

We believe the full configuration of the workspaces appear to be correct, as per the documentation provided. This is preventing any further runs being executed for the project. Please pass the ticket onto Milliman to investigate.

Issue Description:

Jobsteps affected: SIS – SJH in each workspace, for example, in R0476 JS SIS (89b3f025-dbff-42b0-9160-c705fc91739b)
ETL Job affected: https://idm-t2.mgalfacloud.com/#/etljob/t2%7C%7C6b6e50cf-4810-4bc2-9f4d-d8ef6ae2fcdf
Data mart affected: GDSKey = 2021Q2_2021.RC_01_DR6_TCF
Relevant inputs: N/a

Detailed description: In the same 16 jobsteps (SIS-SJH) in each of the 6 workspaces above, some but not all of the results files have been produced (and the jobstep is marked as complete).  For example, in R0476, JS SIS (https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/JobStep/Details?workspaceId=136aa449bc854014a8319185a893cf6e&jobStepId=SIS), the following results files weren’t produced: Rreq.302:Scn.000, Rreq.307:Scn.000, Rreq.322:Scn.000, Rreq.402:Scn.000.  This appears to be consistent across the 96 jobsteps affected, and is preventing the IDM Step1_FCMLoad referenced.  The other results files in these jobsteps, and the other jobsteps have completed.

The fact that the same jobsteps are encountering the problem suggests a modelling issue, rather than a system issue, so I’m going to raise this internally with our MG-ALFA team as well.  Please let me know if you need any more detail.

Scope Agreement:
We will investigate this issue, providing periodic updates as they become available.  We will consider this issue resolved once we have provided an appropriate workaround that allows you to continue working.

Hi Gareth,

Thanks for providing the workflow and advising of the success.

As the workaround has been confirmed, we will continue to work on the RCA of this issue along with next steps.

I can see that the T2 EP is still processing jobs. If you wish to have the workaround applied to that EP too, please reach out when the jobs are finished and we will happily apply it there too.

In the mean time, I will place this ticket on hold whilst we work to provide an RCA.

Kind regards,

Hi Gareth and Jethro,

Thanks for the update.

The P1 Execution Profile was not running and we have therefore applied the back-end grid unit configuration change in P1 on the P1D4v2 Execution Profile. We can see this is the default profile and previously executed ESG jobs, if you require it on the D12 profile, please let us know.

We will await the outcome of your testing. 

Kind regards,

Morning Vishal
 
The jobs in T2 are still running.  I assume the fix is required in P1 as well as T2, so I’d like to propose we take the fix in P1.  This is to support our OAT testing of the new MG-ALFA model going in for Q3, and we need to run XSG today ideally (whereas in T2 we’ve already worked around the issue via direct scenario set uploads).
 
Thanks
Gareth

Hi Jess,

Thanks for advising.

Yes, the grids do need to be stopped with no jobs for us to implement the change. We will keep an eye on the site, however, if you see they complete before we update you please also feel free to let us know.

Thanks Vishal, 
 
The tasks are some long-running BPM workspaces we started over the weekend and will need to complete before the grids can be stopped. 
 
If the change cannot take place until those jobs have completed then we’ll have to wait for them before testing.

Good morning Jess and team,

Thank you for you patience while we investigate this issue.

I am able to report that after our testing yesterday with the side run workflow, the workflow was able to complete all of it's jobsteps without errors. 

We have identified a back-end grid unit configuration change which allowed the test workflow to complete. This change does not impact results or runtimes and can be applied once all the grids within the Execution Profile have been stopped, without downtime to the site. The underlying node type will remain D4_v2 also. 

We will continue to investigate why this configuration change was necessary, however in the meantime to unblock Phoenix, we would like to apply this change to the default Execution Profile (PHXD4v2T2) in T2, for you to test and confirm the workflows now complete please.

Please advise if you are happy for us to make this change.

Kind regards,

Good morning Jess and team,

Thank you for your patience whilst we investigate this issue.

We have identified a potential issue that we wish to investigate further. With your permission, we would like to create a side run to the re-packaged T2 workflow:
https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=7226af4db62d49cca95c1486dc2f9640, using differing and clearly labelled data versions etc.

We would be creating this unique side run with our Tier 2 team and would use unique metadata to ensure it does not interfere with any of your runs or files.

Please can you advise if you approve us executing the proposed side run to further our investigations?

Kind regards,

Morning Vishal, 
 
Having looked back on the previous ticket, it looked as though the file names were inconsistent and after the ESG team were able to rectify the issue, the files created as expected. We don’t believe this is the case with these workflows. 
 
As we are seeing this error across multiple environment, it feels as though there could be an underlying issue that is currently affecting the ESG Production using XSG Workflows.
 
On your recommendation, we asked the ESG team to repackage the workflow inputs for T2 and P1, as both sites were affected by what appeared to be the same error.
 
P1 original workflow – https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=59f24a72770746a1a41dab7b52054f03
P1 repackaged workflow – https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=cc316f51ccf54eae96be0c9e187933b2
 
T2 original workflow – https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=4367a38a10f449a3a3b9b780337c53eb
T2 repackaged workflow – https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=7226af4db62d49cca95c1486dc2f9640
 
Outputs from the original workflows have been downloaded and the outputs have been compared and we don’t believe this is the same as the previous issue from #88390.
 
The inputs used for the T2 1p1g workflow were originally ran through P1 as part of Q2 valuation and successfully produced the files using the same naming conventions and file formatting, suggesting the names were matching correctly at this point : https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=da3bbdb47aca4aaeac097d9aff289ed9
 
The production of these files is now affecting P1 as well as the testing environments, is this something that can be further investigated to try and understand the cause of these errors? 
 
Many Thanks, 
Jess

Hi Janet,

This looks to be a similar issue to that seen in #88390/PHXI0084087.

On review of the logs for the processing of the output from the XSG Scenario Set Pre-Generation step jobstep, there are log entries indicating a file name mismatches during the processing of the output as input file: 

2021-08-16 17:20:16,874 [1] INFO  Milliman.IFP.Workflow.Tasks.TaskHelpers.ProcessResultsHandler - Processing output as input file, Id = ess_all_intycpardown_202106_v1p1gica, Key = gen.scenfile.ess_all_intycpardown_202106_v1p1gica.569c9a6b0a9f4729a20ef246a864bcc0, OutputRepresentation = Other
2021-08-16 17:20:16,874 [1] INFO  Milliman.IFP.Workflow.Tasks.TaskHelpers.ProcessResultsHandler - Could not find a file that matches the pattern = ess_all_intycpardown_202106_v1p1gica*csv
......

2021-08-16 17:20:16,874 [1] INFO  Milliman.IFP.Workflow.Tasks.TaskHelpers.ProcessResultsHandler - Could not find a file that matches the pattern = CalibratedAssumptions.zip
In the previous incident, the ESG team revised the file and the runs were able to complete. 

We would therefore advise that the ESG team review the T2 workflow and feedback their findings please. Please let us know if they/you need any further details to assist their investigations.

Thank you for contacting the Milliman Life Technology Solutions Cloud Service Desk.  We have reviewed your ticket and are providing a copy of our scope agreement for your review.

Service(s) Impacted:
• Integrate Financial Projections (https://t2.mgalfacloud.com/)

Severity:
This incident is being logged with a severity level of 3, which is our default.

Issue Description:
We are trying to reproduce a selection of ESGs originally created in P1-prd in the T2 as part of the DR6 dry run. These workflows use the same XSG components as the equivalent Q2 production runs (see: 2021Q2_ICA_1p1g https://p1.mgalfacloud.com/Workflow/WorkflowDetails?workflowId=da3bbdb47aca4aaeac097d9aff289ed9 ).  Both workflows appear to complete the pre-Gen step successfully, but report errors on all subsequent steps.  Error message is:

        Error running task.  Could not complete calibration. Error details: One or more errors occurred.


We haven’t been able to identify any differences between the T2 and Production versions, and would appreciete Milliman assistance to determe the cause of the errors.
Please pass to Milliman for investigation.
Many thanks,
Janet

Good morning,

This is a notification to advise that our automatic monitoring systems have alerted us to an issue with the P1 (Production) IDM DEI service.

The DEI service has stopped heart beating and needs to be restarted. We are unable to access the server which hosts this service, so are unable to perform the restart ourselves. For further info, the connection hangs here before erroring that it cannot connect:
 

Please can you advise if there is an active issue with the server?

Hello Sebastian,

As this is failing in the Cloud as well as on your desktop we will probably need to investigate the model further.

To assist Milliman with their investigations could you please provide further details on what investigations have taken place internally as I would like to avoid duplication of work if possible.

Also please note I am dropping the severity of this ticket to a severity 4 as this is not a cloud system issue and is more of a model investigation/service request. Happy to discuss further if toy feel this is not appropriate but please be aware we are activity working on this request.

Hi Danial
1. The script needs to be fixed for both issues
2. This fixed script is required for TC1
3. The fixed script needs to be formally delivered
a. NB. If the analysis and solution required for the second issue is extended, PHX will re-visit this decision
Please provide daily updates via this ticket as to the progress on this issue covering:
• Issue 1: Transition script corrected to overwrite i17InputRecID to NA on Scalar File
o Solution developed
• Issue 2: Factor Files not populated with Direct results
o Analysis to date
o Proposed solution
o Expected delivery of solution
I note, by the way, that B3-IDM site is operational

Hi Mike, 
For two issues you are seeing :
• No results for YE18 Transition
o I17InputRecID seems to be the issue here. It is not the same between Model Point File ( set as i17InputRecID = i17CohortID ) and Factor Files ( i17InputRecID = NA)
o IDM scripts should be overwriting i17InputRecID to NA on Model Point File because PHX doesn’t use the New Business/Annual Cohort Functionality 
o This is correctly being done on Subsequent scripts and therefore no such issues there but unfortunately not on Transition scripts
o It seems like we missed this in our testing because the scalar input I used had i17InputRecID already set to “NA” so no such input transformation was actually needed during my tests.
o But in PHX’s case, the scalar input was populated correctly as per the Output Spec and therefore we are seeing this issue. 
o This will require an update to script. 
• IVM Factor Files only have cash flows for Ceded Cohorts for PLG 
o I can confirm that I am seeing this issue as well.
o This will require some investigation from Jay on IDM to see why direct PLG cohorts are being dropped from Factor Files
o B3-IDM site is currently down so this will have to wait until the site is back up and running. 
o This will most likely be a script change too if FCM is producing right results and IDM is not grabbing them properly.
I assume both these issues will require an update/fix to the scripts. I guess the next question here is that if its ok that we fix these issues as part of Phase 2 delivery? Or PHX would like this fixed and tested for TC1?
